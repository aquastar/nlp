WELLINGTON - Authorities have confirmed the objects spotted in the Indian Ocean on Sunday are not parts of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. The New Zealand Air Force reported sightings of several large objects on Sunday. eNCA Asia correspondent John Bailey said search teams have eight days to find flight MH370's black boxes before their batteries die. “If they don’t find these black boxes, there are two of them on the Boeing 777 then it might be that we may never know what actually happened to that plane," said Bailey.
