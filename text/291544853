MALAYSIAN authorities have revealed secret services from the UK, the US and China have been involved in the investigations into the disappearance of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The news adds Â to speculation that the plane's disappearance could be down to terrorism. MI6, the CIA and Chinese agencies have been looking into the flight simulator found in the home of the flight's Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, though acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the FBI has found nothing sinister in the device. He said the Inspector General of Police has highlighted the "four possible scenarios of what could have caused the plane to disappear, which are terrorism, hijacking, personal and psychological problems, or technical failure. "These scenarios have been discussed at length with different intelligence agencies," he added. Meanwhile, Chinese relatives of the passengers on board the missing Malaysia airlines flight MH370 have flown to Kuala Lumpur in frustration to try and find answers from authorities, as an American naval officer has said the search could take years. The relatives claim they have not been given enough new information from authorities dealing with the search, and on Sunday held a press conference in which they held up banners and the Chinese flag, chanting: "We want evidence, truth, dignity. "The group, of which some have accused Malaysian withholding information, held up banners that read: "You must return relatives of MH370, no strings attached". They have demanded an apology from authorities for its handling of the disaster, and for Prime Minister Najib Razak's earlier statement that suggested the plane had crashed with no survivors. Two-thirds of the 227 passengers on board the flight that went missing on 8 March were Chinese.  Jiang Hui, the relatives' designated representative, said the group felt the decision that there would be no survivors was made without sufficient evidence. More on this story at The Independent
