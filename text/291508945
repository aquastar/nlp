Australian air force pilots say they have spotted several pieces of orange debris while searching for missing Malaysia Airlines jet MH370.  It was unclear if the material was from the missing plane, authorities said, but further investigations are under way.  Rescuers hope to pick up signals from the plane's black box recorder before it stops emitting.  The plane has been missing for more than three weeks
