A holder of a stolen passport on the missing Malaysian airliner was a young Iranian, not believed to have terrorist links, Malaysian police say. It is believed the 19-year-old was an Iranian asylum seeker – named as Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad – who was planning to enter Germany, they say. The identity of the other man who used a stolen passport to board the flight is still being investigated, Inspector General Khalid Abu Bakar told a news conference. Experts have been left baffled over exactly what caused flight MH370 to disappear from radar screens nearly four days ago. Speculation has ranged widely about what went wrong, including pilot error, plane malfunction, hijacking and terrorism. The developments were announced as the search area for the missing airliner widened. Malaysia Airlines said the hunt had expanded beyond the flight path, with teams now searching the west peninsular of Malaysia at the Straits of Malacca. That is on the other side of Malaysia from where flight MH370 was reported missing, with search teams now looking in both areas. Vietnam’s deputy military chief also said he had ordered a land search for the plane up to the border with Laos and Cambodia. Authorities are looking at a possibility that MH370 attempted to turn back toward Kuala Lumpur in the early hours of Saturday en route to Beijing. Malaysia Airlines says the pilots didn’t send any distress signals, suggesting a sudden and possibly catastrophic incident.
