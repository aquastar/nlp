Malaysian palm oil futures dipped on Tuesday on profit-taking after the tropical oil surged to a 17-month high in the previous session, although worries of dry weather tightening supplies curbed losses and kept prices propped up. Benchmark prices on Monday had hit 2,910 ringgit per ton, their highest since mid-September 2012, after industry data showed that end-stocks in the world´s No. 2 producer fell steeply to an eight-month low of 1. 66 million tons. “There´s a little bit of profit-taking but there is still concern over the weather, and whether yields will pull down further this month,” said a trader with a foreign commodities brokerage. “There could be a further drawdown in stocks in March, unless we see good rains in the next 48 hours,” said the trader.  Prices will likely trade between 2,850-2,920 ringgit in the next two days, the trader added.
