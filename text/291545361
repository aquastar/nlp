Ship and plane crews are searching a vast new area of Indian Ocean in hopes of finding wreckage from the Malaysian Airlines plane which went missing three weeks ago. Sightings of floating objects in the new zone, which is closer to land, means search planes will be able to spend more time in the air before having to refuel. Support teams have said they face a formidable task in finding small pieces of wreckage in the remote location. The Boeing 777 went down on March 8th with a total of 239 people of many nationalities on board. The task of finding the missing plane is being undertaken by Australia, with many other countries now involved. The US Pacific Fleet has moved specialised black box locator equipment to Perth, the closest city to the target zone. China, which lost 153 people in the plane crash, has sent ships to search for unidentified objects which had been spotted from the air. A Chinese air force Ilyushin IL-76 has also been flying out of Pearce Air Base in Western Australia, the main military base near Perth. China's state news agency has claimed unidentified floating objects are now within the sights of their ships, with the Chinese government saying it hopes that wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines plane will finally be found. Three weeks of conflicting leads have led to angry scenes from desperate relatives who have insisted the plane be found so appropriate ceremonies can be held for deceased relatives. Families have been asking why, with debris already spotted, nothing hs yet been recovered. Recent data have indicated the plane was most likely flying faster than first thought before running out of fuel over the sea. The flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, has become one of the major mysteries in modern aviation with many theories being mulled over. The Malaysian government has already suggested the plane was deliberately taken from its flight path by someone on board before being flown thousands of miles off course, over the Indian Ocean.
