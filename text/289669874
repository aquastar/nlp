KAJANG: The government channelled RM440 million saved from the sugar subsidy cut into healthcare facilities, deputy finance minister Datuk Ahmad Maslan said yesterday. He said the government has utilised the fund to build 50 1Malaysia clinics, 30 rural clinics, to repair and upgrade hospitals, and to employ 6,800 new nurses nationwide. Ahmad said the government decided to channel the proceeds saved from the subsidy cut for the benefit of the people. "One of the main reasons the government decided to cut the 34 sen sugar subsidy was due to the high diabetic cases in the country. "And when we try to prevent high sugar consumption for a healthy lifestyle, then we have to ensure that proper healthcare is also provided," he said in his speech when meeting the Indian voters in Taman Kajang Baru yesterday. Ahmad added that when there is a saving, the government is able to allocate additional fund for the people. The government slashed 34 sen from the sugar subsidy in October last year over reports of some 2. 6 million diabetic patients in the country. He was addressing the Indian community in Taman Kajang Baru as part of the Barisan Nasional (BN) campaign for its candidate Datin Paduka Chew Mei Fun for the Kajang state seat. Food and basic welfare are among the main focuses of BN in its campaign to woo Indian voters. Several gatherings with the Indian community saw each household receiving goods like rice, sugar and flour, as well as home appliances like iron and kettle. Chew will be facing Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah, who is the wife of Pakatan Rakyat's de facto leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, at the polls on March 23.
