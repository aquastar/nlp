Search teams hunting Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 have only a week left before the plane’s black box stops emitting signals. If they fail to home in close enough before the device’s batteries run out, the task of solving one of the world’s biggest aviation mysteries will become even harder. An Australian warship carrying a device called a ‘towed pinger locator’ – on loan from America – was sent to try to pick up a signal from the box today. But it will take up to four days for the boat to reach the search zone. The desperate hunt continued amid renewed protests from the families of passengers on the plane, which vanished on March 8 with 239 people on board. Relatives of Chinese passengers flew to Kuala Lumpur to demand that Malaysia’s government apologise for its handling of the crisis. They held up banners reading ‘Hand us the murderer’ and ‘We want evidence, truth, dignity’.  Rescuers are scouring an area roughly the size of Poland, about 1,850 km (1,150 miles) to the west of Australia, in the Indian Ocean. The focus of the search changed on Friday after radar data revealed the Boeing 777 had been flying faster and burning fuel quicker than previously thought.  Recovery of the black box and the plane’s cockpit voice recorders could become further complicated because the sea floor in the new area contains two deep trenches. Several objects have been recovered from the ocean – but last night none had been confirmed as coming from the plane.
