Several Chinese travel agencies are said to have placed a ban on the reservation of Malaysian Airlines flights intended to travel to the Southeast Asian nation. The move came weeks after a Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 went missing after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on the way to Beijing on March 8. About two-thirds of the 227 passengers on board were Chinese citizens and the rest others citizens of 12 other countries. Many residents of mainland China, including several outspoken celebrities, have called for an official travel boycott on Malaysia, the Business Insider reported. Spurred by conversations by users that mostly took place online, several Chinese online ticket and travel booking websites have announced their refusal to book Malaysia Airlines flights.
