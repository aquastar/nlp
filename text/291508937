Another day of searching the Indian Ocean failed to turn up any sign of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Sunday. The Australian agency coordinating the search says the only objects scooped up by crews of ships so far have been "fishing equipment and other flotsam" not connected to the jetliner that disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board. A warship equipped with an aircraft black box detector is joining the search, but it could take days for Australia's ADV Ocean Shield to reach the search zone. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which oversees the search, says the ship will depart Sunday from Perth. The ship is fitted with the U. S.  Navy's Towed Pinger Locator and an unmanned underwater vehicle, as well as other acoustic detection equipment. Meanwhile, 29 frustrated Chinese family members, seeking answers from Malaysia's government as to what happened to their loved ones, arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. Two-thirds of the 227 passengers aboard Flight 370 were Chinese.
