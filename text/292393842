PUTRAJAYA - The Malaysian government is not hiding any crucial information pertaining to the missing MH370 flight from the public as suggested by opposition leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. Umno secretary-general Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor said it was a tragedy that no one had hoped for in the first place and was baseless for Anwar to say that crucial information was hidden. Labelling Anwar as a "crazy chap", the Federal Territories Minister also said that the public should be rational and assess the news that have been given by the relevant authorities on the tragedy. He hoped that the people would understand that the government is doing the best they can to locate the Boeing 777-200ER and they should be a better judge on how the authorities are handling the mission that has involved the help from various countries. Anwar was quoted in a British daily, The Telegraph, as saying the Malaysian government had deliberately concealed information that would help explain the missing plane. He also said that when he was Finance Minister in 1994, he had authorised the installation of "one of the most sophisticated radar" systems in the world, known as Marconi, based near the South China Sea and covering Malaysia's mainland and east and west coastlines which would be able to detect the radar from the plane.
