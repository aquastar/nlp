Taiwan on Monday (March 10) sent out vessels to join the search for a Malaysia Airlines jetliner that has remained missing for over three days, local media reported. They quoted Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration as saying that the vessels are expected to arrive on Friday (March 14) at noon at the area where the Malaysian jetliner went missing on Saturday (March 8). "When we got the notice at noon, we immediately prepared the mission to head to the search area of where the Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane has met with accident.  We hope to arrive at the search as fast as we can," Taiwan National Defense Ministry spokesman Chien Jih-cheng said. "Primarily the mission is rescue, to see if we can search for the passengers who were involved.  Doing our best for rescue work. " he added. The fate of the Malaysian airliner that vanished about an hour into a flight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur remained a mystery, as a massive air and sea search, now in its fourth day, failed to turn up any trace of the Boeing 777 plane.
