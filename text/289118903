An Indian woman, daughter of the late Indian minister Mohan Kumaramangalam, has reached Beijing after it was confirmed that her Indo-Canadian son and Chinese daughter-in-law were on board the Beijing-bound Malaysian Airlines aircraft that went missing Saturday. Uma Mukherjee, who lives in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is the daughter of the late Mohan Kumaramangalam, who was a minister in Indira Gandhi's cabinet.  He was among the 48 people killed when an Indian Airlines plane crashed near New Delhi airport in 1973. Mukherjee travelled from her home in Dubai to the Chinese capital after it was confirmed that her son Muktesh Mukherjee, 47, and his wife Xiaomao Bai, 37, were listed as passengers on flight MH370, the Arabian Business online reported Tuesday. The Indo-Canadian man is vice-president of operations in China for the Pennsylvania-based XCoal Energy and Resources and was travelling with his wife when the flight left Kuala Lumpar Saturday morning and disappeared off the coast of Vietnam on its way to Beijing. For Uma and her family, this is the second time that a tragedy has hit in four decades since Mohan's death.  His son, P. R. Kumaramangalam, who served in the union cabinets of P. V.  Narasimha Rao as well as A. B.  Vajpayee, died in 2000.  The fate of the Malaysian aircraft remained a mystery despite the enhanced search continuing for the fourth day Tuesday. Intelligence agencies from across the world, however, have not ruled out the possibility of terrorists being involved in downing Malaysia Airlines' flight.
