SIBU: The open day at the campus of University College of Technology Sarawak (UCTS) yesterday had the atmosphere of a carnival. UCTS campus opened to the public from 10am to 4pm yesterday. According to the UCTS senior manager (marketing and corporate) Lu Yew King, the open day served two purposes – to accept new students for the foundation course, and to allow members of the public to better understand UCTS. “The foundation course is open to SPM leavers, and the intake is this month.   The foundation course is 100 per cent scholarship, but on condition that they continue their degree here,” he said. He said the intake for the degree courses would be in September. UCTS is offering 11 degree courses this year: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering (power), Electrical and Electronic, Food Technology, Architecture, Quantity Survey, Business Administration, Accounting, Computer Science (Network), and Computer Science (Software Engineering). Lu said UCTS fully supported by the state government catered to students in the Central Region. “Our fee is the lowest among private universities and colleges in Malaysia, because we are fully supported by the state government,” he said. PTPTN loan and hostel accommodation are available to students who want to continue their degree there. He said UCTS had links with universities in the United Kingdom, and Germany. There were briefing sessions about UCTS programmes and Career Analysis (EQ Assessment). Other side activities include charity food fair, campus tour, performances by UCTS students, photography contest and health checks.
