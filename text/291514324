KUALA LUMPUR: A Sunday night downpour did not stop 20 members of the Malaysians for Malaysia movement from gathering at Taman Tasik Titiwangsa in Kuala Lumpur to extend their prayers for those on board MH370. There were prayers in Bahasa Malaysia, English and Mandarin, and even a recital of a poem in Iban. The crowd, including an ex-Malaysia Airlines crewmember who flew to Beijing to be part of the airline's effort to take care of the families, shared what they remembered and felt about those onboard MH370. The plan was to release 239 purple balloons - each carrying the names of everyone onboard the flight - into the sky. Due to the rain, most balloons ended up on the surface of the Titiwangsa Lake. "I take it as a blessing from the heaven.  Maybe there's something good out there," said movement member Latika Abdullah, who works in an oil and gas company. Datin Paduka Marina Mahathir said the act is to give hope to the grieving families. "It's a way of telling them we are all behind them.  We feel very much a part of them.  As a mother, a wife, a sister and a child, I cannot imagine the devastation they go through. "Hope is very important.  It's what sustains them.  We are hoping for an answer.  Hopefully God will give us some signs," she said.
