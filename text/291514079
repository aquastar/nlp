And now on to the latest in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. China and Australia confirmed on Saturday that items they scooped up in the southern Indian Ocean late last week were NOT related to the missing airliner. And so the search continues. The Australian defense vessel Ocean Shield headed out today to help with the efforts in the updated search area, which is some 18-hundred kilometers west of Perth and roughly the size of Poland. The Ocean Shield boasts a black box detector, an unmanned underwater vehicle and other acoustic detection equipment, but could take days to reach the search zone. Meanwhile 29 Chinese family members of the missing passengers, frustrated with the lack of progress, flew to Kuala Lumpur on Sunday to seek answers from Malaysia's government.
