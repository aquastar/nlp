BEIJING: Beijing yesterday blamed Kuala Lumpur for a lack of information about a vanished Malaysia Airlines flight, as tearful relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers aboard voiced frustration with all sides of the response effort. Nearly two-thirds of the 239 people aboard Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight MH370 were from China, and if the loss of the aircraft is confirmed, it would be China’s second-worst air disaster in history. “The Malaysian side attaches importance to the incident with a sincere attitude, but in light of the situation, the Malaysian side needs to step up their efforts,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters at a regular briefing. Qin declined to pinpoint any specific areas of the Malaysian response with which Chinese authorities were dissatisfied, noting that “the incident is still under investigation”. But China’s state-run media minced no words yesterday, lashing out at Malaysia and its national carrier over their handling of the missing jet, demanding answers despite the early stage of the investigation and calling for a swifter effort. Officials said two Europeans whose names were on the passenger manifest — who both had their passports stolen in Thailand — were not on board. “The Malaysian side cannot shirk its responsibilities,” the Global Times newspaper, which is close to China’s ruling Communist Party, wrote in a scathing editorial.  “The initial response from Malaysia was not swift enough. “There are loopholes in the work of Malaysia Airlines and security authorities,” it said. “If it is due to a deadly mechanical breakdown or pilot error, then Malaysia Airlines should take the blame.  If this is a terrorist attack, then the security check at the Kuala Lumpur airport and on the flight is questionable. ”China itself regularly enforces heavyweight security, while authorities are often secretive about real or alleged incidents.  — AFP
