KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia—Malaysia Airlines says it is investigating an Australia television report that the co-pilot on its missing flight had invited two women to stay in the cockpit for the duration of a flight two years ago. Jonti Roos spoke about her flight on the program “A Current Affair,” which aired multiple still photographs from Roos that showed the women inside the cockpit and the pilots apparently working the plane’s controls. The airline said late Tuesday it wouldn’t comment about the report until its investigation into it is complete. Roos said she and her friend were allowed to stay in the cockpit during the entire one-hour flight in December 2011 from Phuket, Thailand, to Kuala Lumpur.  She said the arrangement did not seem unusual to the plane’s crew. Fariq Abdul Hamid and the other pilot talked to the women, smoked and posed for photos during the flight, she said.  The second pilot was not identified. “Throughout the entire flight they were talking to us, and they were actually smoking throughout the flight,” Roos said. Roos didn’t immediately reply to a message sent to her via Facebook.  The second woman, Jaan Maree, could not be located. Hamid, 27, the first officer of the missing plane, has about 2,800 hours of flying experience and has worked for Malaysia Airlines since 2007.
