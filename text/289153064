BALASINOR (Gujarat): In a hard-hitting attack on Narendra Modi on his home turf, Rahul Gandhi today accused his government of "stealing" farmers' land and charged the BJP with appropriating credit for schemes launched by the Congress-led UPA.   Without directly naming the Gujarat Chief Minister, Gandhi also alluded that Modi works like Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and attacked him for retaining "corrupt" ministers in his state cabinet while talking tall of fighting corruption.   "What kind of chowkidari (guarding) is happening in Gujarat.  Lakhs of acres of land are being taken away from the farmers and being given to industrialists.  When farmers say something, their voice is ignored.   "Is stealing the land of farmers chowkidari.  This is called theft and not chowkidari," Gandhi said addressing a rally in Balasinor, the first destination of his tour programme.   Modi has been saying in his rallies that he will work like a 'chowkidar' of the nation's treasury if BJP government came to power.   Seeking to draw a parallel between BJP's India Shining Campaign in 2004 Lok Sabha polls and its focus on Gujarat's development under Modi, Gandhi said it is being publicised in the whole country that Gujarat shines but its sheen is limited to few industrialists and the poor have not benefited from it.   BJP had lost the 2004 polls and the India Shining campaign of the NDA not going down well with the electorate was attributed as one of reasons.   Accusing BJP of taking credit for programmes initiated by Congress, Gandhi said in a sarcastic tone that the leaders of the Opposition party will claim after a decade that they had also brought MNREGA and Right to Food, the flagship programmes of Congress-led UPA.   "There are two kinds of leaders.  The first type belongs to those who go among people, have some ideology and believe in the knowledge of people.  He goes to them, asks them and learns from them.  The thinking of this kind of leader is that it is the people who are repository of knowledge.  Such a leader wants to understand people and has no pride.   "Then there is another kind of leader, whose best example is perhaps Hitler.  Hitler thought there was no need to go to people.  He believed entire knowledge of the world is only in his mind.  That kind of leader only talks that he did this and that.  That leader does not require to go to people," Gandhi said.   The Congress Vice President had in the past also compared Modi to Hitler.  - PTI NEW DELHI: In a jolt to Aam Aadmi Party, National Executive member Ashok Agarwal today quit the party, saying it has become "directionless" and functions like a private limited company.   In a letter to party's National Convener Arvind Kejriwal, Agarwal, who has been associated with the party since its founding days, said that he joined the party for strong principles, but the goals for which it was created for are getting lost.   "The movement seems to have become directionless causing doubts in the minds of people and even people like me who are today feeling the party is functioning like a private company.   "The connect of Aam Aadmi is on wean and a group of elite individuals is promoted to take over the party.  Aam Aadmi has taken a back seat and what's on the mind of such individuals is personal projection at the cost of that very Aam Aadmi vision," Agarwal said in the letter.   The National Executive Committee is the second most important committee in the party after the Political Affairs Committee.   Confirming Agarwal's quitting, party's national spokesperson Deepak Bajpai said, "He never raised these issues at party forum.  Had he done, we would have addressed the issues. " He said that the party learnt about his resignation through the media.   AAP sources also said that Agarwal was keen to contest from Chandni Chowk, but the party fielded former journalist Ashutosh from the constituency.  Despite repeated attempts Agarwal could not be contacted.   On one hand, when new people are joining the newly formed outfit, some members who have been associated with the party since its inception days are quitting.   Former AAP leader Madhu Bhaduri, a former diplomat, quit the party and condemned the Khirki extension case in which Somnath Bharti, then Delhi's Law's Minister, undertook a midnight raid on Ugandan women's residence.   Another National Council member Ashwini Upadhaya had also accused the party of "parachuting" candidates and deviating from its goals.  - PTI  SRINAGAR: Kashmir Valley was today cut off from rest of the country due to heavy snowfall as the arterial Srinagar-Jammu national highway remained closed while flights to the city airport here could not operate.

Sena made its stand clear in the wake of speculation that the party may review its longstanding alliance with the BJP after arch rival MNS declared that it would challenge the Sena in all seats in Lok Sabha polls, but will support Narendra Modi's candidacy as Prime Minister.   An editorial in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana said today, "The alliance between the Shiv Sena and BJP is the oldest in the country. . .  nobody needs to worry, it is strong. . .  The BJP and Shiv Sena came together to strengthen Hindutva. " In a related development, Maharashtra BJP President Devendra Fadnavis met Uddhav.   "I conveyed to Uddhavji that BJP considers Sena its natural and trusted ally," Fadnavis said after the meeting.   "BJP cadres will work only for Mahayuti (the five party grand opposition alliance led by Sena BJP)," Fadnavis said, after meeting Uddhav at the latter's residence Matoshree in suburban Bandra.   The Maharashtra Narvnirman Sena is an offshoot of the Shiv Sena, headed by Uddhav's cousin Raj Thackeray.  The two parties have fought bitterly for largely the same constituency in the last few elections, which has helped the rival Congress-NCP combine become stronger in the state.   BJP leader Nitin Gadkari had recently met Raj Thackeray in Mumbai, to suggest that the MNS not contest the general elections to avoid dividing opposition votes.  - PTI
