PERTH, April 6 (Bernama) — The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight MH370 has been intensified in the southern Indian Ocean after a Chinese ship had detected a pulse signal probably from the aircraft’s black box as its disappearance entered its 30th day. On Saturday, Haixun 01 picked up the signals with a frequency of 37. 5 kHz. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC), in a statement, today said a total of 10 military planes, two civil planes and 13 ships would assist in Sunday’s search for MH370. It said the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) had three separate search areas planned for today covering an area about 2,000 kilometres north west of Perth, with a total of approximately 216,000 square kilometres. “Weather in the search area is expected to be good with a cloud base of 2,500 feet and visibility greater than 10 kilometres,” said JACC.
