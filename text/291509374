(03-31 11:07) Australian vessel Ocean Shield, fitted with a device known as a towed pinger locator and an autonomous underwater vehicle that can comb the seabed using electronic sensors, was to leave Perth today.  Captain Mark Matthews from the US Navy said the crash site of the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 must first be narrowed down to allow any pings from the recorder to be located.  “It is critical that we find that surface debris so we can reduce the area that we'd need to conduct an underwater search in,'' he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  “Right now the search area is basically the size of the Indian Ocean, which would take an untenable amount of time to search.
