To cap off a month filled with medical emergencies and in-flight passenger deaths, an Oman Airways flight made an emergency landing at the Chennai Airport early on Monday morning, after a passenger suffered a “seizure-like fit”.  According to airport sources, Oman Airways flight WY 825 that was flying non-stop from Muscat to Kuala Lumpur, made an emergency call on their airline channel and said that an Indonesian passenger called Revimartini Noorudeen needed immediate medical attention. The Air Traffic Control tower was alerted and after less than 10 minutes, they were allowed to land during the peak flying period, at 4. 50 am.  With a waiting medical team to stabilise her, they wheeled her into the airport’s emergency medical centre, run by Apollo Hospitals.  “They managed to stabilise her with drugs, once they identified that it was indeed a stroke thrown by a blood clot,” said an Airports Authority of India official. A stroke is caused when a blood vessel in the brain begins to bleed or when a blood clot from any part of the body gets lodged in the brain. They can be treated with drug intervention, if the patient receives medical care within 30 minutes.  Failure to do so can cause paralysis or even death. A study by a London-based vascular surgeon in 2004 established a link between patients who had stroke and flying in economy class. According to the findings, sitting in cramped economy-class seats during long haul flights often caused blood clots that could move up to the brain and cause a sudden stroke.  However, not enough substantial medical evidence is available in this area. After a delay of nearly three hours, the passengers of the KL flight boarded it again and departed for the Malaysian city at 7. 50 am, where it landed safely.  It was delayed by five hours. The passenger is reportedly safe and undergoing medical treatment at a multi-specialty hospital in the city.
