The police are probing the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, psychological problem of those on board, and personal problem among the passenger and crew. Malaysia’s Police Chief, Chi Hu, said on Tuesday that one of the two men holding fake passports that boarded the Malaysian airline which vanished last week was an Iranian national. He said at a conference that the Iranian man was not related to any terrorist group and the identity of the other man was being investigated. Malaysia police had also released the photo of the Iranian national at the conference. The police chief also said they were looking for possibility of hijacking, sabotage, psychological problem of those on board, and personal problems among the passenger and crew. Earlier, the International Police Agency (Interpol) confirmed that only two passports recorded in the data were used by passengers on board the missing plane. The Malaysia Airline had issued a new statement, saying that the search and rescue efforts had been expanded beyond the flight path. “Search team has also been looking for the plane and survivors on land. “All our effort will be made to search for the missing Malaysian plane.  I hope everything can turn better, and a miracle can happen for the plane,” said Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, Kong Xuanyou. Kong, who spoke to Chinese and Vietnamese media during an interview in Vietnam’s capital Hanoi, said after being informed of the Malaysian jet incident, the Chinese government instructed embassies and consulates in concerned countries to activate emergency mechanism to assist in the search and rescue operation. Five Chinese search and rescue vessels, including two warships, were searching for the missing flight MH370 as at 3 p. m.  Beijing time, the China Maritime Search and Rescue Centre, said on Tuesday. The flotilla comprises two South China Sea rescue vessels, a marine police vessel, and naval vessels Jinggangshan and Mianyang.
