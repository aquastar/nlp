The global police organisation Interpol has begun to work with Southeast Asian countries in an effort to ensure there is no repeat of the incident which downed Malaysian Airlines flight MH370. Interpol had been concerned about lapses in immigration checks and border security. Plane travellers are now likely to be asked to go through tighter security checks following revelations that two passengers boarded the jet using stolen passports. While Interpol has a database of lost or stolen passports, planes are sometimes still being boarded without passengers' travel documents being screened against the list. The agency has been having talks with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to enhance border security at airports and other checkpoints. Interpol has said it wants governments to become more responsible for people leaving the country as well as entering it. Passports often go missing in Southeast Asian countries, with theft a common problem. There has recently been an increase in counterfeit passports with the rise in international tourism. In many cases authentic stolen travel documents have been used for criminal purposes.
