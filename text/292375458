As many as 402,730 Indonesians registered with the Overseas Election Committee (PPLN) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia cast their votes for the legislative election on Sunday.  Malaysia has recorded the highest number of Indonesian voters for this year’s election. PPLN Kuala Lumpur head Freddy M. Panggabean said Indonesians voted via three different methods.  Those residing in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor cast their votes at polling stations while those working in companies or plantations submitted their ballots at a drop box.  Meanwhile, Indonesians living far from Kuala Lumpur and Selangor and not employed with companies or plantations mailed their ballots back to the PPLN office. “Of the more than 400,000 people listed in the final voter list, 322,492 cast their votes directly at polling stations while 45,319 voters chose to use the drop box.  Meanwhile, the remaining 34,919 voters mailed their ballots back to the PPLN office,” said Freddy as quoted by tempo. co. The PPLN setup several polling stations outside Indonesian offices on account of the high number of voters. “We are providing polling stations at the Indonesian Embassy, the Kuala Lumpur Indonesian School and the Wisma Duta.  Outside those places, we have polling stations in several places, such as in Klang, Shah Alam and Gombak,” said Freddy.  (idb/ebf)
