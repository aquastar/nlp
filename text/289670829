KUALA LUMPUR: The current number 03-7884 1234 for general enquiry over the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will change effective noon today. MAS, in a statement, said families of passengers and crew of MH370 should instead call 03-8777 5770. “This is a dedicated number, dedicated for families only,” it said. Meanwhile, for media queries, journalists can contact 03-8777 5698 or 03-8787 1276, and for latest updates on the missing flight, people can visit www. malaysianairlines. com. The incident involving the MAS airplane has not dampened foreign investors’ confidence over the country’s security, said Deputy International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Hamim Samuri. He said on the contrary, business confidence and outlook among them climbed due to the Government efficiency in coordinating the search and rescue operation involving a number of countries. “There is no reason why foreign investors could have lost confidence in our security as Malaysia has won praises over the handling of the missing flight MH370,” he said after attending a seminar on the Goods and Services Tax here yesterday. He said investors were aware of the conducive investment environment created by the Government. Earlier in his speech, he criticised the Opposition for calling for the Prime Minister to resign over the delay in announcing the disappearance of the aircraft. Hamim said the Government could not announce the developments of the ensuing search for the plane until it received accurate and collaborated information to prevent repercussions that could tarnish its image.  — Bernama
