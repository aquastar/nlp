The head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said Tuesday that terrorism could not be ruled out in the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. CIA director, John Brennan (pic), was quoted by AFP as saying that there had been "some claims of responsibility" over the missing jet that had "not been confirmed or corroborated", and that he could not exclude the possibility of a terror link. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Brennan described as “very disturbing” that the Boeing 777 had yet to be found. Flight MH370, carrying 239 people including a 12-member crew, disappeared on Saturday about an hour after departing Kuala Lumpur International Airport for Beijing shortly after midnight. A massive search and rescue operation by armed forces from several nations including the US entered its fourth day Tuesday, with no sign of the plane. The discovery that two passengers had boarded the flight using stolen passports has fueled speculation of foul play. Earlier, a little known group calling itself the Chinese Martyrs’ Brigade reportedly claimed it was behind the disappearance of the jet, but authorities in Malaysia have dismissed the claims as not credible.  –  March 11, 2014.
