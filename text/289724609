U. S.  Naval personnel scan the water for any sign of the Malaysian Airlines flight that went missing more than a week ago.  They've also deployed Sea Hawk helicopters to search for debris.  No easy task in light of the fact that authorities still can't pinpoint just what happened to the plane.  Former pilot Sully Sullenberger says its a worrying sign.  SOUNDBITE: Aviation expert and former pilot Sully Sullenberger saying: "The aviation industry never normally tolerates this level of ambiguity. " He knows firsthand the many variables that can bring down a flight .  Sullenberger famously landed a U. S.  Airways flight on the Hudson River several years ago after birds flew into the engine.  More than a week after the crash, there are more questions than answers.  SOUNDBITE: Aviation expert and former pilot Sully Sullenberger saying: "You know, many of the possibilities verge on a spy novel kind of situation.  We simply don't know.  Those (UNINTEL) that you mentioned are theoretically possible.  The real frustration is that we are learning more about this as Mark and Bob have said very late in the process.  And with the passage of time, it makes the variability in the search much greater and it makes it much harder ultimately to find out what really did happen. " Malaysian authorities are now looking into the backgrounds of the plane's crew as they search for a possible motive for why the plane disappeared.
