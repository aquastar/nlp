KUALA LUMPUR, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Media reports saying Malaysia has ruled out hijacking, mid-air disintegration and radar malfunction as possible reasons behind missing flight MH 370 are false, the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia told Xinhua Tuesday. Recent media reports said Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang told reporters Monday that Malaysia had ruled out that five factors including hijacking, mid-air disintegration and radar malfunction were behind the disappearance of the Boeing 777-200.  These media reports were severely mistaken, an embassy official said. The aircraft suddenly vanished from radar early Saturday morning while carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.  Among the passengers, 154 are Chinese. Huang said Monday current work is focusing on searching for the plane and any speculation over the cause of its disappearance is groundless before the aircraft is found, according to the official. Huang added that the Malaysian authorities have made great efforts and adopted a serious attitude in their search for the plane. At a government briefing to Prime Minister Najib Razak, which Huang attended, Malaysian technicians checked and analyzed usual causes of missing aircraft, such as hijacking, the mid-air disintegration of plane and the malfunctioning of electronic systems, but they did not make any conclusions, the official said.
