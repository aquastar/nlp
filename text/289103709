KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s military believes a jetliner missing for almost four days turned and flew hundreds of kilometres to the west after it last made contact with civilian air traffic control off the country’s east coast, a senior officer told Reuters yesterday. In one of the most baffling mysteries in recent aviation history, a massive search operation for the Malaysia Airlines  Boeing 777-200ER has so far found no trace of the aircraft or the 239 passengers and crew.  Malaysian authorities have previously said flight MH370 disappeared about an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur for the Chinese capital Beijing. “It changed course after Kota Bharu and took a lower altitude.  It made it into the Malacca Strait,” the senior military officer, who has been briefed on investigations, told Reuters. That would appear to rule out sudden catastrophic mechanical failure, as it would mean the plane flew around 500 km at least after its last contact with air traffic control, although its transponder and other tracking systems were off. A non-military source familiar with the investigations said the report was one of several theories and was being checked. At the time it lost contact with civilian air traffic control, the plane was roughly midway between Malaysia’s east coast town of Kota Bharu and the southern tip of Vietnam, flying at 10,670 metres. The Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest shipping channels, runs along Malaysia’s west coast. Malaysia’s Berita Harian newspaper quoted air force chief Tan Sri Rodzali Daud as saying the plane was last detected at 2. 40am.  by military radar near the island of Pulau Perak at the northern end of the Strait of Malacca.  It was flying about 1,000 metres lower than its previous altitude, he was quoted as saying. — Reuters
