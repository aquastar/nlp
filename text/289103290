HANOI–The head of Vietnam’s Civil Aviation Authority Wednesday said the country hadn’t received any confirmation from Malaysia on reports that Malaysia had tracked missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 to the Strait of Malacca on the western side of Malaysia. Lai Xuan Thanh, also a member of Vietnam’s search and rescue coordination team, said that Vietnam would minimize its search for the missing plane in the South China Sea, where its search efforts have been focused until now, until it gets confirmation from Malaysia about the tracking reports. Mr.  Thanh told The Wall Street Journal that “we haven’t received any official confirmation from Malaysian authorities. ” He said that Vietnam will keep its search operation at a minimal level Wednesday while awaiting word from Malaysia instead of deploying its four search aircraft. “If Malaysia confirms that the plane was tracked to the Malacca Strait, we will have to stop searching,” Mr.  Thanh said. Responding to some media reports that the plane flew as far west as the Strait of Malacca, Malaysian Air Force Chief General Rodzali Daud issued a written statement Wednesday denying that he told the local press that the plane had last been seen in the vicinity of Pulau Perak, an island in the Strait, at 2:40 a. m.  before its signal disappeared without a trace. Gen.  Rodzali referred to earlier statements and said they were still valid, and that the air force had not ruled out the possibility of a turn back before the aircraft vanished from the radar, resulting in the search area being widened.  The statement described the local media reports as “inaccurate and incorrect. ”
