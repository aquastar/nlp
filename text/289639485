LONDON: In a fresh twist to the bizarre disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, a London-based satellite company has revealed that it received "keep-alive messages" - establishing that the plane's communication systems were on - from the airliner hours after civilian radars lost contact with it. Inmarsat, a British satellite telecommunication provider, said the missing plane was equipped with one of its signalling systems which actually sent out a barrage of messages much after it was lost to the world. The company, however, refused to specify exactly how many such messages it picked up from the aircraft and at what time. The company said it is sharing all the details with the investigative agencies world which are trying to locate the plane. In a statement, Inmarsat said, "Routine, automated signals were registered on the Inmarsat network from Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 during its flight from Kuala Lumpur.  This information was provided to our partner SITA, which in turn has shared it with Malaysia Airlines. "Inmarsat is the leading provider of global mobile satellite communication services.  It provides reliable voice and high-speed data communication to governments, enterprises and other organizations, with a range of services that can be used on land, at sea or in the air. Experts say the information from Inmarsat could prove to be a valuable breakthrough in the frustrating search for the plane which mysteriously vanished from the radar screens last week with 239 people on board.
