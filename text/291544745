KUALA LUMPUR: Former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad launched The Politics of Bangsa Malaysia: Nation Building In a Multiethnic Society at a hotel here yesterday. The launch was held during Universiti Utara Malaysia's (UUM) high-tea event, "An evening with Tun M", to celebrate the institution's 30th anniversary.  Some 180 alumni members attended. The book was written by Vice-Chancellor Professor Datuk Mohamed Mustafa.  It explores Malaysia's nation-building process post-1970. Dr Mahathir, the founder of UUM, said the university had come a long way since it first started in 1984, when it was in Sintok, Kedah. He said at the time, the nation was in need of good management universities, as it was a criterion that most Malaysians lacked.  He said Malaysians needed to learn from history to better themselves as the nation marched towards achieving Vision 2020.
