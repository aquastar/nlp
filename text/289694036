Former Pakistan president General (rtrd) Pervez Musharraf's accomplices were behind the issuing the November 3, 2007 emergency order. The recent application, filed by Musharraf in the special court, points fingers at the alleged co-conspirators behind the actions. If accepted, the application would implicate a number of high-profile civilians and armed personnel in the treason trial. According to Dawn News, the application Musharraf recently filed in the special court demands that the civilian leadership and the military authorities should also be tried along with him. According to the proclamation issued for the November 3 emergency, Musharraf imposed the emergency after consulting the then prime minister, the governors of all four provinces and the chairman of joint chiefs of staff committee, the chiefs of the armed forces, the vice-chief of army staff and the corps commanders of the Pakistan Army, the report said.
