Representative Peter King (R-NY) told a This Week With George Stephanopoulos panel that U. S.  intelligence has no indication of terrorist involvement in the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH 370, which vanished without a trace eight days ago. “There’s been no terrorist connections whatsoever,” King said.  “There’s been no terrorist chatter.  There’s nothing out there indicating it’s terrorism.  Doesn’t mean it’s not.  But so far nothing has been picked up by the intelligence community. ”King chided Malaysian officials for not focusing on the pilots first, and said he still had unanswered questions about the two Iranians travelling on stolen passports. “The fact they were there and written off so quickly as having any threat,” King said.  “I mean, why did they have to get on that plane to seek asylum? The fact it was so easy for them to get on with stolen passports.  It creates a terrorist atmosphere.  Having said that, there’s nothing showing it.  I just wouldn’t rule it out. ”Watch the clip below, via ABC News:
