Vietnam has decided to end the search mission for a missing Malaysian jet, a senior military officer said at Vietnam's National Committee for Search and Rescue on Saturday. Vo Van Tuan, deputy chief of the General Staff of Vietnam People's Army, told reporters that the decision was made after Vietnam had received information from Vietnamese Ambassador to Malaysia Nguyen Hong Thao Saturday afternoon that Malaysia has decided to end search in the South China Sea. Do Ba Ty, chief of the General Staff of Vietnam People's Army and deputy defense minister, announced the decision at a meeting held at the headquarters of the Defense Ministry upon consideration of the information. Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 , a Boeing 777-200ER with 239 people on board, disappeared suddenly early last Saturday en route to Beijing. In hunt for the vanished plane, Vietnam allowed vehicles from China, Singapore, the United States, among others, to conduct search in its waters, Tuan said. "So far, Vietnam has not received any official request from Malaysia to send Vietnamese vehicles to search for the airplane in other areas, however, Vietnamese defense minister and chief of the general staff of Vietnam People's Army have consented that the country is ready to join the mission once receiving the request," Tuan told Xinhua. During the search operation, Vietnam's 11 aircraft have flown 55 sorties, while its seven vessels have combed an area of over 100,000 square meters to search for the plane, Tuan said. This is the largest search and rescue operation with the most modern vehicles that Vietnam has launched so far, Tuan said.
