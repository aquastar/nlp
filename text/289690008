AUSTRALIA has sent one RAAF jet, with a second on standby, to help the growing international effort to find the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Prime Minister Tony Abbott confirmed on Monday the two jets, AP-3C Orion aircraft, were supporting Malaysia's search mission for the aircraft. He also said Australian intelligence authorities were "scouring the data" in an effort to help try and locate the missing plane and the 239 on board the flight when it disappeared a week ago. Defence Force Chief General David Hurley said one of the Orion aircraft was searching the Indian Ocean to the north and west of the Cocos Islands. He said the second Orion would continue to search west of Malaysia, with both aircraft flying more than 51 hours on search missions to date.
