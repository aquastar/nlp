KUALA LUMPUR: The Indonesian embassy here has set up three polling centres to facilitate the voting process for about 400,000 Indonesian registered voters in Malaysia to cast their votes in the country's legislative election today.      Indonesian Ambassador to Malaysia Herwan Prayitno said Indonesian nationals could cast their votes, from 9 am to 6 pm, at the three centres being set up at the Indonesian embassy, Sekolah Indonesia and official residence of the Indonesian ambassador.   "The embassy is targeting 100,000 Indonesians in the country to exercise their rights.   "We also have set up collection centres at the Indonesian settlements throughout the country," he told reporters here today.   He said the embassy had provided 102 places for postal votes and ballot drop boxes for those who were unable to get to the polling centres.       Herwan said the Indonesian government would use for the first time the indelible ink in the voting process.   "We will assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the indelible ink in the election this year," he said.   An Indonesian construction worker, Sulinanto, 38, said the people of Indonesia must fully exercise their rights and be able to choose a calibre leader to bring changes for the people and the country.   "I wish I have chosen competent leaders for a future better for Indonesia," he said.   According to Indonesia’s General Elections Commission (KPU) there are about 170 million Indonesians eligible to vote, which includes expatriate Indonesians.
