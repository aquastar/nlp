One of the passengers using a stolen passport on a missing plane was an Iranian asylum seeker, Malaysian police have said. Police chief Tan Sri Khalid Tan Sri said the man was a 19-year-old who was believed to be planning to reach Germany and was not believed to be a member of a terrorist group. He said the second passenger using a stolen passport has not been identified. Authorities have not found the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 three days after it disappeared from radar screens, and the discovery that two passengers used stolen passports to buy tickets has raised questions about their motives for being on the flight. Rescuers in several countries are searching for the plane which had 239 people on board.
