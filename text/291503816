Ten aircraft and eight ships have joined the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane in the Indian Ocean. It's the busiest day of the air and sea search so far with hopes the flight recorder may be located. The flight recorder's batteries are due to run out in a matter of days and therefore it's crucial they find the black box soon. Reporter Alistair Bunkall is in Kuala Lumpur.  He says one of the vessels has been fitted with a special black box detector.
