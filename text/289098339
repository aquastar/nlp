SEPANG, Malaysia - Maritime officers remain unfazed despite growing frustration over the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency director-general Admiral Datuk Mohd Amdan Kurish said he and his men are not giving up on their search for the elusive aeroplane. Despite the lack of sleep and rest, Admiral Mohd Amdan said he and the rest of his men were feeling more committed than ever in their task. "It is frustrating when we have no inkling of what happened to the plane.  We are following up on every possible lead 24 hours a day," he said during an interview here yesterday. Admiral Mohd Amdan and his men are among the personnel on 34 aircraft and 40 vessels from different nations scouring the area where the Boeing 777-200 was last spotted. In these past four days, he said he had thought of various strategies in the search and rescue. "All my men are mobilised daily for the search and my men are all spent.  They will be lucky if they can catch a few hours of sleep each day," he said. With no clue to the whereabouts of the plane, Admiral Mohd Amdan said it was important for those searching to keep an open mind on where to look. "One thing is for sure - we will never give up," he said. The area for the search and rescue operation has now been expanded to include the region south of where the plane disappeared from radar. "We are also scouring the Straits of Malacca.  For now, it is still a mystery for all the agencies involved in the operation," he added.
