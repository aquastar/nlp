BEIJING: Relatives of Chinese passengers on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 were still clutching to faint straws of hope for their loved ones Tuesday, four days after the aircraft went missing. “I hope it is a hijacking, then there will be some hope that my young cousin has survived,” said a man in his 20s surnamed Su. Families and friends of many of the 153 Chinese passengers — more than two-thirds of those on board the flight to Beijing — are gathered at the Lido Hotel in Beijing, waiting for news. “My uncle and aunt had an emotional breakdown, they are not eating, drinking and sleeping and could not face coming here,” said Su.  “They need our help.  We have been telling them lies — stressing the few positives in all of this — to keep their spirits up. ” Malaysia Airlines has offered to fly two relatives of each of the missing to Kuala Lumpur to be closer to the search, but Su said the family was worried for the welfare of his cousin’s grief-stricken parents if they made the trip alone.  “We have offered to pay for ourselves, so the wider family can help our aunt and uncle,” he said.  Inside the hotel ballroom, family members sitting in rows of seats watch a plasma television screening continuous news.
