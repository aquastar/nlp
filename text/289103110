Malaysia Airlines would not comment further until it has investigated the report that the co-pilot on the missing flight MH370 had allowed an Australian and her friends into the cockpit.  — Reuters picKUALA LUMPUR, March 12 — Malaysia Airlines (MAS) says it is investigating an Australian television report that the co-pilot on the missing flight MH370 had invited two women to remain in the cockpit during an entire flight two years ago. The airline said it would not comment about the report until its investigation into it is complete. In a programme called "A Current Affair", Jooti Roos said she and her friend were allowed to stay in the cockpit during a one-hour flight in December 2011, from Phuket, Thailand, to Kuala Lumpur. Fariq Abdul Hamid, the co pilot on the missing flight MH370 and another pilot talked to the women, smoked and posed for photos during the flight, she alleged.
