SUBANG JAYA: Royal Malaysian Navy chief, Admiral Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Jaafar has clarified there no submarine were being used in the seacrh-and-rescue mission to locate the missing aircraft of Malaysia Airlines (MAS) Flight MH370. He said this was because the submarines, which are installed only with sonar detector systems, were incapable of performing the task of detecting static objects on the seabed. “The sonar systems installed on the navy’s submarines are unable to detect or track any static objects at sea surface level, but it can only detect moving objects or those emitting sounds,” he told reporters after visiting the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) Air Traffic Control Centre here today. He was accompanying Defence Minister and Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein. Abdul Aziz said to detect objects on the seabed, it was usually done by fully equipped vessel sonar system, which is more capable in detecting sea surface level objects like submarine rescue vessels, hydrographic vessels and mine detectors. He said such vessels had been deployed to the operation areas, including MV Mega Bakti, KD Perantau, KD Mahameru of Royal Malaysian Navy and MV Swift Rescue from Singapore’s navy. “So I hope after this clarification there will be no allegations or inquiries why our submarines were not used in the SAR operation,” he said.  — BERNAMA
