(03-11 16:20) Taiwan has sent a warship, transport plane and patrol ships to the search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777.  A guided missile frigate and two patrol boats departed Taiwan at 3 pm on Monday and a C-130 transport plane took off from its base at 3:30 p. m.  the same day, according to Taiwan's military and maritime patrol authorities.  The patrol boats were expected to arrive in the target area Friday noon.  A Taiwan passenger was reported to be on board the Malaysia Airlines flight to Beijing, which lost contact with controllers early Saturday.  Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation launched an emergency communication mechanism after receiving the report and contacted the mainland-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits at noon on Saturday, said SEF vice chairman Ma Shaw-chang. â€”Xinhua
