NEW DELHI, India—An Indian official says navy and air search operations for the missing Malaysian aircraft have been put on hold until fresh search areas are identified by the Malaysian government. Colonel Harmit Singh, spokesman for India’s tri-services command, says coast guard ships have reverted to routine surveillance in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The Indian navy and air force’s coordinated search for the last three days has so far covered more than 250,000 square kilometers in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal without any sighting of the Boeing 777 and 239 people aboard. It disappeared more than a week ago after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur on the way to Beijing. Focus turns to pilots as hunt for Malaysia Airlines jet widens
