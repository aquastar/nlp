Something rotten is going on off the state of Sweden.  A foreign something, nobody is sure what, has been reported floating close to Stockholm.  Could be a submarine, could be a man in black, which begs a question how big is the man, or small the submarine.  Well, must be a really big one if the Swedish navy has declared the area off limits to civilian navigation, and the skies above have been designated a no fly zone, as if the Baltic country is next to Syria or Libya.  But small enough to be found in four days of a massive search.
