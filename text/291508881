PERTH, Australia â€” A day after the search for the Malaysian jetliner shifted to a new area of the Indian Ocean, ships on Saturday plucked objects from the sea to determine whether they were related to the missing jet.  None were confirmed to be from the plane, leaving searchers with no sign of the jet three weeks after it disappeared. Meanwhile, a Chinese military plane scanning part of the search zone, which is roughly the size of Poland, spotted several objects floating in the sea, including two bearing colors of the missing jet. It was not immediately clear whether those objects were related to the investigation into what happened to the plane, and the second day of searching in the new area ended with no evidence found.
