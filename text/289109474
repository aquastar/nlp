MANILA, March 10 (PNA) — The Independent Minority Bloc of the House of Representatives on Monday said they will call for an immediate inquiry into the airworthiness of all aircraft nationwide and the safety of the air travel industry. Leyte Rep.  Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, who heads the House Independent Minority Bloc, said all aircraft, both commercial and government owned, needs to undergo thorough inspection and will not be allowed to fly unless they pass the tests. Romualdez was alarmed over the sudden disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH-370, which suddenly vanished from radar screen off the coast of Vietnam about an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing early on Saturday morning. “The safety audit we’ll carry will not only be on the technical but more importantly, of the security aspect as well,” Romualdez told reporters at the weekly news forum of the bloc.  “We want to know how often and how thorough are inspections of aircraft carried out by concerned government agencies. ”According to the veteran lawmaker, they want to find out “if their systems and procedures are up-to-date and in accordance with international standards.  If yes, how effective have these been and in what manner? If not, what is or where is the problem and what are they doing about it?”“And since terrorism is now being considered as one of the possible causes of Flight MH370’s disappearance, air travel authorities had better enlighten us on how ready are we against possible terroristic act,” he stressed. He said they want to know how up-to-date is our air travel officials with the names, photos and other related data on terrorists, both local and foreign. “Are they looking for any terrorist here in the country? Is the air travel industry facing any threat? If yes, from whom? If air travel officials will say no, what makes them so secure?” Romualdez asked.  (PNA)
