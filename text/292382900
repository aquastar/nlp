KUALA LUMPUR: MCA Youth has hit back at Perkasa over allegations that the party was meddling in the country’s Islamic affairs. Its Legal Bureau chief Eric Choo Wei Sern stressed that neither the bureau nor the MCA did this. He said all the party did was to take a stand based on the existing laws of the country. He said PAS’ hudud law was inconsistent with what had been entrenc­hed in the Federal Constitution. “Furthermore, the PAS administration has a track record of imposing Islam law on non-Muslims,” Choo said. “Therefore, it is MCA’s responsibility and duty to oppose and stop any attempts by PAS that will jeopardise the peace and harmony of the country,” he said, calling on Perkasa to respect Malaysia’s law and judicial system. Last week, Kelantan announced that it would table a private Bill in Parliament that would seek a declaration to implement hudud law in the state. Choo also refuted Perkasa’s claims that MCA was biased and silent over the use of the word “Allah”. He urged all parties to be patient over the issue pending the Federal Court’s judgment. “We not only did not remain silent, a group of MCA lawyers also held a watching brief in court,” Choo pointed out.  “This shows the sincerity and persistence of the party to find a legal solution based on the law through the justice system — unlike Perkasa which only demonstrated outside the court during the case. ”
