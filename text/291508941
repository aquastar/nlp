Nine aircraft and eight ships searched a 252,000 square kilometer area for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on Sunday, with reported sightings of objects floating in the waters of the southern Indian Ocean. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority repeated the cautionary statement at the end of the search day that "Objects sighted by aircraft cannot be verified or discounted as being from MH370 until they are relocated and recovered by ships. "With over 300 objects spotted floating in the search area waters over the past week, AMSA reported "Nothing has yet been verified as being from MH370. "Investigators were able to determine that objects recovered by the Royal Australian Navyâ€™s HMAS Success and Chinese Maritime Administration patrol ship Haixun 01 on Saturday "are not believed to be related to MH370" as they appear to be "fishing equipment and other flotsam. "The objects sighted by aircraft on Sunday were "similar to those reported previously. "On Monday, the Australian defense vessel Ocean Shield -- outfitted with a black box detector and autonomous underwater vehicle -- will be dispatched from Perth to aid the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The plan disappeared March 8 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
