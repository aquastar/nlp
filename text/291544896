KUALA LUMPUR: The Foreign Ministry is trying to verify if any Malaysian was in a guesthouse attacked by Taliban gunmen in Kabul on Friday, a spokesman said. "We are still unable to provide further information.  Our embassy has been trying to contact the Afghanistan Embassy as well the British High Commission in New Delhi, but could not get through. "Gunfire and explosions rocked Kabul on Friday as Taliban militants attacked a guesthouse used by a US-based aid group, the latest violence to hit the city ahead of next weekend's presidential election.
