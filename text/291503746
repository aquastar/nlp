PASIR GUDANG: China continued to produce more women’s singles stars when newcomer Yao Xue nailed her first international title at the Malaysian Open Grand Prix Gold at Pasir Gudang Municipal Council.   On Sunday, the 23-year-old Yao Xue defeated Indonesia’s old timer Adrianti Firdasari 21-18, 21-8 in the women’s singles final to show that she is one to watch out for in future.    Training under former men’s singles world champion Chen Jin, Yao Xue said that it was her patience that saw her winning her first title in three attempts.    She was the runner-up in both last year’s Malaysian Open Superseries and the Indonesian Open Grand Prix Gold.    “The opening set against my opponent was so important.  I was pushed but I stayed patient, waiting for my opportunities to strike.  It worked and gave me a lot of confidence to go all the way to win it,” said Yao Xue.    “This is a new beginning for me.  This win has given me a lot of motivation to achieve more excellence in my career,” said Xao Yue, who lost in the semi-finals of the Malaysian Open Superseries in January.    Asked when she would be a world class player like her seniors Wang Yihan and Wang Zhixian - not to mention a few, the modest Yao Xue said: “I have not thought that far yet.  I adore these players and for now, I just look up to them and try to emulate what they do during training.  If I give my best in training like them, I will go far. ”  Besides winning her first career title on Malaysian soil, asked what was her other good memories in Malaysia, she said with such a big smile on her face: “I love durian and during the Malaysian Open GP, I took the opportunity to have a feast here.  I do get these fruits in China but it is nothing like eating it here. ”
