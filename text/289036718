PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - Accomplished calligrapher Liu Rusheng, who was on board MH370, fought death six times, as detailed in an article he wrote in 2006. The 77-year-old from Jiangsu province's Nanjing city in China had travelled with his wife Bao Yuanhua, 63, to Kuala Lumpur for a three-day art exhibition themed "Chinese Dream: Red and Green Painting" before they boarded the Beijing-bound plane. Liu wrote in his article, posted on Chinese websites, that he survived his first duel with death as an infant during World War II. With four other older children in the family, his parents had no choice but to abandon him in their house a few times when they had to run away from Japanese soldiers. "Actually, my parents did not expect me to survive.  But whenever they came back, they were shocked to see me still alive," he said. "In the second incident, I just learned how to ride a bicycle and collided with a truck.  I was trapped underneath the truck and was dragged. "Later during a swimming trip with a few friends, Liu nearly drowned. In his adulthood, he suffered several heart attacks - once when training at an army camp in 1971 and then on a train to Dunhuang in 1982. He suffered another heart attack at home in 1993 but managed to cycle to a nearby hospital for help. Amazed at his luck, he wrote: "After having escaped death several times, I enjoy and treasure life even more. "It is said that he usually brought with him a rubber stamp that carries the words "shang cang hou wo", which means "God bless me" in Chinese. Also on MH370 was a family of five who came to Malaysia for vacation.  Before their return to Beijing, Jiao Weiwei, 31, had posted online the photos of her vacation with her parents, her husband and their two-year-old son, reported Hong Kong's Apple Daily. In one of the pictures, she described her boy as a "gift". Jiao's grandparents rushed to Beijing once they heard of the news.  The two looked worried, with teary eyes.
