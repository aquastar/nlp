PETALING JAYA - The revelation that Malaysia Airlines flight MH370's Aircraft Communications and Reporting System was switched off before its last radio message was sent has brought the focus of investigations back to the pilots. Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein told the media yesterday that the ACARS was turned off before the message. Previously, it was reported that the system was turned off after the last voice contact. The pilot had said: "All right, good night" as Malaysian Air Traffic Control handed over the plane's monitoring to Vietnam. However, it was still not known whether it was the voice of flight captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid before the plane carrying 239 passengers and crew disappeared from radar and veered off course 10 days ago. ACARs provides satellites detailed information about a plane's movements and current status. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said police had searched the home of Zaharie in Shah Alam. He said the pilot's self assembled flight simulator was being looked at by experts as part of the investigation, adding that investigators had also searched the co-pilot's home.
