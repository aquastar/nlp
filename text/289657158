PETALING JAYA: Police are looking into the flight simulator built by MH370 flight captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah. In a statement on Saturday, the Transport Ministry said police "as per normal procedure" were investigating all crew, passengers, as well as engineers who may have had contact with the aircraft before take-off. "Police searched the home of the pilot on Saturday 15 March.  Officers spoke to family members of the pilot and experts are examining the pilot's flight simulator," the statement said, adding that police also searched the home of the co-pilot Saturday. "We appeal to the public not to jump to conclusions regarding the police investigation," the statement said. The statement also said Malaysian officials were contacting their counterparts in at least 15 countries located along the northern and southern corridors where MH370 could have flown along to seek assistance. "Officials are requesting assistance (from these countries)," the statement said, adding that Malaysia was also asking related countries to provide further assistance including satellite data and analysis, ground-search capabilities, radar data and maritime and air assets. Malaysian officials were currently discussing with all partners how best to deploy assets along the two corridors. "Both the northern and southern corridors are being treated with equal importance," read the statement. It was reported that a group of policemen conducted a search at Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah’s house in Shah Alam on Saturday afternoon. Three policemen in an MPV were seen at the gated community in Section 13 at around 2. 40pm.  They left at 4. 45pm. It was unclear if they took away a flight simulator from the house.
