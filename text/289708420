India had deployed five warships and six surveillance aircraft for the search operation.   Earlier in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein today said the number of countries involved in search mission for Flight MH370 had nearly doubled to 25.   "The number of countries involved in the search and rescue operation has increased from 14 to 25," Hussein told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur. Hussein also confirmed Premier Razak spoke to his counterparts in India, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Besides, he said Malaysian Foreign Ministry officials on Sunday briefed representatives from at least 22 countries, including India, and sought their help in the search, which hadÂ "entered a new phase". The help includes satellite and primary radar data and requesting deployment of sea search assets, the minister said.    The Beijing-bound jetliner carrying 227 passengers, including five Indians and one Indian-Canadian, and 12 crew members mysteriously vanished from radar screens an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on March 8.    There has been no trace of the plane or any sign of wreckage despite a search by the navies and military aircraft of several countries across Southeast Asia.
