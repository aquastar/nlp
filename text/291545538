Malaysia Airlines said Sunday it will arrange trips to Perth for relatives of passengers of flight MH370 only once it has been authoritatively confirmed that the physical wreckage of the missing jet is found. Arrangements will be made as soon as the relevant government agencies have provided clearances for Malaysia Airlines to bring family members to the site where aircraft wreckage will be kept, the company said in a media statement.
