(Flight MH370) Search turns to Andaman Sea, Vietnam calls off some operations  (03-12 10:36) The search for a missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 that disappeared early Saturday has been expanded into the Andaman Sea, hundreds of kilometers to the northwest of the original search radius, an official said.  â€œYes, above Sumatra is the Andaman Sea,'' Malaysian civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman told AFP when asked to confirm whether ships and planes were searching for missing flight MH370 in that location.  Sumatra is a large Indonesian island south of the Andaman Sea.  The body of water is off Thailand's west coast.  Meanhwile Vietnam said it was suspending the air search for missing Malaysian jet.  "We've decided to temporarily suspend some search and rescue activities, pending information from Malaysia,'' deputy minister of transport Pham Quy Tieu said, adding a sea search was still ongoing, but on a smaller scale.
