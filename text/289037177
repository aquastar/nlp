On Monday, China blamed Malaysia for a lack of information about the vanished Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight, as tearful relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers aboard voiced frustration with all sides. Nearly two-thirds of the 239 people aboard MAS flight MH370 were from China, and if the loss of the aircraft is confirmed, it would be China's second-worst air disaster in history. The Chinese government "urges the Malaysian side to step up their efforts to speed up the investigation and provide accurate information to China in a timely fashion," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang. China's state-run media lashed out at Malaysia and its national carrier over their handling of the missing jet, demanding answers despite the early stage of the investigation.
