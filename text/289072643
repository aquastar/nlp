Beijing is deploying as many as 10 satellites in hopes of tracking down Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, state media reported Tuesday, as the search for the vanished aircraft entered its fourth day. The high-resolution satellites, which are controlled from the Xian Satellite Control Centre in northern China, will be used for navigation, weather monitoring, communications and other aspects of the search-and-rescue effort, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Daily said. Nearly two-thirds of the 239 people aboard flight MH370 were from China, and if the loss of the aircraft is confirmed, it would be China's second-worst ever air disaster. Crews from nine countries have joined the international search effort, including China, Malaysia, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, New Zealand, Indonesia, Australia and Thailand. The relatives of Chinese passengers were still clutching to faint straws of hope for their loved ones Tuesday. "I hope it is a hijacking, then there will be some hope that my young cousin has survived," said a man in his 20s surnamed Su. Families and friends of many of the 153 Chinese passengers are gathered at the Lido Hotel in Beijing, waiting for news. "My uncle and aunt had an emotional breakdown, they are not eating, drinking and sleeping and could not face coming here," said Su. "They need our help.  We have been telling them lies -- stressing the few positives in all of this -- to keep their spirits up. "Malaysia Airlines has offered to fly two relatives of each of the missing to Kuala Lumpur to be closer to the search, but Su said the family was worried for the welfare of his cousin's grief-stricken parents if they made the trip alone. "We have offered to pay for ourselves, so the wider family can help our aunt and uncle," he said.
