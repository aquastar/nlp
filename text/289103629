Aviation experts have said that it is not that hard to believe the Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 might have just disappeared because of the size of the South China Sea. The experts believe the jet will be found eventually because only a small number of jets have not been found since the advent of aviation in the 1958, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. "The world is a big place," University of Queensland, professor of aerospace engineering Michael Smart said. "If it happens to come down in the middle of the ocean and it's not near a shipping lane or something, who knows how long it could take them to find?""I can't think of a water crash in the jet age that hasn't been solved," Leeham Co managing director Scott Hamilton. Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, who is heading the investigation for the Malaysian Civil Authority, said that tracking the remains of the flight was not simple. “We have no witnesses on the ground and nobody on the plane can be contacted, the area is over the sea, so it's not as easy as that,” Mr Abdul Rahman said. The plane’s last location was tracked last Saturday, over the Malacca Straits.
