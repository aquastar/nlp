The search for the missing Malaysia Airline plane has failed to find any debris in the Indian Ocean despite the hunt being stepped up. Nine aircraft and eight ships from half a dozen countries have been scouring the area on the busiest day of the operation so far,Â however time is running out as the flight recorder's batteries are due to run out within days. Meanwhile - relatives of passengers on board the flight have held a protest in Malaysia shouting "We want evidence! We want truth!".
