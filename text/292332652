A pulse signal has been detected for a third time in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Authorities were eager to point out that the ‘acoustic events’ may not necessarily be connected to the missing airliner but did concede that their discovery was an ‘important and encouraging’ lead. Chinese search teams had picked up the first signal yesterday morning that emitted at the same frequency (37. 5hz) as that of the black box on board the Malaysia Airlines plane.  The black box’s batteries could run out as early as tomorrow. ‘This is an important and encouraging lead, but one which I urge you to treat carefully,’ explained search coordinator Angus Houston. ‘I have made clear, that these signals and the objects could not be verified as connected to the missing aircraft… that remains the case,’ he added. The new pings mean that greater priority will be given to the southern search zone in the Indian Ocean, a few hundred kilometres from Australia’s west coast. China’s official Xinhua news agency had reported yesterday morning that two pings had been picked up within a few kilometres of each other. News then broke this morning that an Australian ship had found a third ping, but that this was over 550km (340 miles) away. ‘The job now is to determine the significance of that event,’ explained Mr Houston.  ‘It does not confirm or deny the presence of the aircraft locator on the bottom of the ocean,’ he added, referring to each of the three transmissions. Flight MH370 went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board.  Last month Malaysian authorities said they believed ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’ the Boeing 777 has crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, with no survivors, but no wreckage has yet been found.
