Relatives of Chinese passengers from missing flight MH370 have flown to Kuala Lumpur, seeking answers from the Malaysian authorities.  They checked into a hotel outside Kuala Lumpur on Sunday morning.  The family members are here for more information on the fate of the missing Malaysia airlines jet, which disappeared four weeks ago.  They also want to meet the prime minister and transport minister face to face.  They have accused officials of mishandling the investigation.  The airliner disappeared on 8th March with 239 passengers on board.  Most of them were Chinese.  As the families arrive, Chinese and U. S.  search teams head out to look for remains of the plane in a vast area of the Indian Ocean.  Ten ships and as many aircraft are taking part in Sunday's search operations.  Malaysian officials are now sure the missing plane flew into the sea somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean.  But so far no trace of it has been found.  Until some debris can be linked to the missing jet, many relatives of passengers on flight MH370 refuse to accept the authorities' version of events, and continue to hope their loved ones are still alive.
