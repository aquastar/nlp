On the day when all opposition parliamentarians boycot the Dewan Rakyat sitting, the prime minister makes a rare appearance. KUALA LUMPUR: All 89 Pakatan Rakyat MPs boycotted today’s Dewan Rakyat sitting in protest against alleged “injustices” against opposition leaders. Opposition Leader Anwar Ibrahim announced the boycott last Saturday, and this included skipping a lunch reception after the opening ceremony yesterday. Anwar said this was in protest against his conviction by the Court of Appeal on a sodomy charge and DAP chairman Karpal Singh on a separate sedition charge. Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak made a rare appearance in the House to answer a question on the rising cost of living, the first question in the order paper. Najib did not face much trouble fielding questions posed by BN’s Kinabatangan MP Bung Mokhtar Radin and supplementary questions from his BN colleagues. He boasted about his various efforts to combat price hikes, which made one wonder if he could have gotten a free hand if opposition MPs were present in the House. Minister in the Prime Minister Department, Shahidan Kassim mocked the opposition, telling the House: “Hopefully the empty seats would be filled by the BN in the next elections”. The opposition’s non-attendance also prompted speaker Pandikar Amin Mulia to abandon the many questions filed by Pakatan in the order paper, as per the House procedures.
