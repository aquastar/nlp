Taiwan's state-owned oil company CPC Corp said Friday that it has reached an agreement to take delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States starting in 2018. CPC said it has signed a 20-year contract with Paris-based GDF Suez to take delivery of about 800,000 tons of LNG per year from the French company's Cameron LNG partnership project in Louisiana. According to CPC, it will be the first time it takes delivery of LNG from the United States. GDF Suez is the largest non-nuclear power supplier and third largest LNG buyer in the world, and it has an annual production capacity of 4 million tons of LNG at the Cameron project, the Taiwanese oil giant said. CPC said the agreement is part of its efforts to diversify its LNG sources and secure LNG imports. Currently, CPC supplies about 13 million tons of LNG a year, almost all of it imported from Indonesia, Malaysia, Qatar, Papua New Guinea and Australia.  The state oil company said it will continue to seek other LNG sources to further secure supply for Taiwan. Earlier this month, CPC signed six-year agreements with its Malaysian counterpart Petroliam Nasional (Petronas) to buy 2. 25 million tons of LNG annually, starting in April. With LNG imports to Taiwan on the rise, CPC said, it is preparing to acquire new transportation and storage facilities, including three storage tanks in Taichung.
