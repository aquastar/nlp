Relatives of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have demanded answers in an angry news conference while Australia admitted that all search efforts had so far drawn a blank. Thirty-nine Chinese family members of 18 passengers arrived in Kuala Lumpur today to meet Malaysian officials in an attempt to gain information about the fate of their loved ones, now missing for more than three weeks. “You must return relatives of MH370, no strings attached,” said a banner held by the group in the press conference.  Another read: “Tell us the truth.  Give us our relatives back. ”
