A Libyan lawmaker has proposed the deployment of troops from "friendly countries" under the umbrella of the Arab League to help Libyan army disarm the country's militias. "Jordanian troops can be deployed in the eastern region, Mauritanians in the southern region and Moroccans in the western region," Salih Jaaoda, the deputy chairman of the parliament's National Security Committee, told Anadolu Agency on Sunday. "Malaysian and Indonesian troops can be responsible for collecting arms," he said. Jaaoda asserted that all these troops should be deployed in his country under the umbrella of the Arab League. AA could not immediately obtain comments from the pan-Arab organization on the proposal. Jaaoda warned that the ongoing turmoil, assassinations, arms trade and radicalism could prompt the United States to ask Libya's strong neighbors to intervene militarily in the country. LibyaÂ has been struggling to restore order more than two years after the ouster of late strongman Muammar Gaddafi.
