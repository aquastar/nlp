One of the two suspects who used stolen passports to board the missing Malaysian Airlines flight has been identified. Malaysia's Inspector General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said the man had been identified based on CCTV footage from Kuala Lumpur International Airport. "I can confirm that he is not a Malaysian, but cannot divulge which country he is from yet," he said at Kajang police headquarters yesterday. When asked if both suspects had immigration records showing entry into Malaysia, Khalid said police were in the midst of investigating the case. "The man is not from Xinjiang, China," he said in reference to the autonomous region that is home to the Uighur, an ethic Muslim minority waging a deadly battle with Beijing. Most of 293 passengers on flight MH370 are Chinese.  Nearly 20 Uighur were secretly deported to China from Malaysia in 2011 and 2012, said New York-based Human Right Watch. Malaysian authorities are sceptical of the unheralded Chinese Martyrs' Brigade claim that it was responsible for the missing aircraft. "We do not have verification of a Chinese militant group claiming responsibility for the missing plane," Khalid said, adding that his personnel were investigating the case from all angles. He said they had yet to classify the missing plane as being linked to terrorism. "Let us investigate the matter thoroughly," he said, urging the public not to speculate further on the matter. Malaysian Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein also doubts the claim by the Chinese group. "There is no sound or credible grounds to justify their claims," Hishammuddin told reporters at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
