Australia’s military and intelligence agencies haven’t uncovered anything pointing to the path of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday as his country began searching far into the southern Indian Ocean. “All of our agencies that could possibly help in this area are scouring their data to see if there’s anything that they can add to the understanding of this mystery,” Mr.  Abbott told reporters in Canberra as Australia’s air force began widening its search in response to a weekend request from Malaysia. News reports last week said satellite transmissions may have been detected more than 620 miles west of the Australian city of Perth.  That remote area of ocean has an average depth of almost 13,000 feet and only a few islands around the rim. The southern Indian Ocean is something of a twilight zone for international aircraft and shipping movements as it is poorly covered by radar from surrounding nations. Over the weekend, Malaysian authorities coordinating the search for MH370 directed an Australian AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft to look to the north and west of the Cocos Islands, an Australian territory midway between Australia and Sri Lanka. The range of the aircraft is around 2,000 nautical miles.  It is more than 3,000 miles from Cocos to the Kerguelen Islands, also known as the Desolation Islands, in the far south of the Indian Ocean, with empty sea in between. The new search area is broadly along one of two tracks identified by Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak as possible paths taken by the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200.  One track pointed northwest to Central Asia, while the other went southwest into the Indian Ocean. Up to now, Australia has sent two aircraft to assist in the search for MH370, on which six Australians were travelling.
