MUMBAI: Sanved Kolekar, whose parents and brother from Yogi Nagar in Borivli were on board the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, and his wife Tejashri landed in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia on Tuesday, along with the family members of other passengers. While the couple had travelled from Beijing, where Sanved is pursuing his post-doctoral research, his two friends and a relative, who had caught a flight from Mumbai, also reached Kuala Lumpur to be with them. Even as the search-and-rescue team failed to solve the mystery of the missing MH370 flight on the fourth day, relatives and friends are frustrated over the lack of information.  A friend of the Kolekars said Sanved, his wife, relative and friends are put up in a hotel in Malaysia along with the other families.  They were initially put up at Lido Hotel in Beijing, from where they were moved to Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, "for better co-ordination". Sanved's father Vinod (63), mother Chetana (59) and brother Swanand (23) are among the 239 people on Flight MH370 that went missing from the South China Sea off Vietnam in less than an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur on March 8.  They were headed to Beijing for a holiday with Sanved, who had moved there in December 2013 to pursue his post-doctoral research after completing his doctorate from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics.
