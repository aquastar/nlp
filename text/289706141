SINGAPORE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Defense Ministry said Saturday night that its armed forces will continue to support the search-and-locate operation in the Malacca Strait with the Republic of Singapore Air Force Fokker-50 Maritime Patrol Aircraft which was deployed to Butterworth Air Base, Malaysia, on Friday. The ministry said that following the Malaysian authorities' announcement earlier on Saturday that the search-and-locate operation for MH370 in the South China Sea has been called off, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has ceased its search efforts there as well. Since March 8, the SAF has supported the operation in the South China Sea with ships and aircraft, such as a C-130 aircraft, a Formidable-class frigate with a Sikorsky S-70B naval helicopter on board, a Victory-class missile corvette, as well as a submarine support and rescue vessel with divers on board. They are on their way back to Singapore. The ministry added that the SAF stands ready to provide further assistance to Malaysia in support of the search-and-locate efforts.
