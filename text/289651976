Jimmy Choo is considering going public as flotation fever shows no signs of ending. Owner Labelux, which also controls womenswear label Bally, has had preliminary meetings with bankers about the possible sale of its stake in the luxury shoemaker via an initial public offering, a person close to the matter said. Labelux would retain a majority stake in the business and use the sale to fund expansion in Asia, where sales are rising, it is understood.  The business could be valued at about £1bn (€1. 2bn).  Labelux bought Jimmy Choo in 2011 for more than £500m. The flotation would follow luxury-goods makers like Moncler, Salvatore Ferragamo and Brunello Cucinelli in offering stock to the public as Asian demand fuels growth and draws investors.  The value of shares in Ferragamo, which sells €486 patent-leather platform heels, have more than doubled since they were listed in Milan in 2012 and 2011 respectively. Jimmy Choo has changed hands four times in the space of 15 years.  The company traces its roots back to the skilled Malaysian cobbler of the same name, who was based in east London in the early 1990s. It officially launched in 1996 after Mr Choo and his niece, Sandra Choi, teamed up with former 'Vogue' fashion editor Tamara Mellon, who helped propel it into a global fashion brand. Jimmy Choo now has more than 150 outlets in 32 countries and a string of celebrity fans, from Victoria Beckham and Jennifer Lopez to Samantha Cameron.
