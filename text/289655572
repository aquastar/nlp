Sources told Malaysian news agency Bernama that "all of Bangladesh's available resources will be deployed to assist Malaysia", starting with two patrol aircraft and two frigates. "We will begin seaching in the Bay of Bengal and coordinate with your (Malaysian) navy to seach the Indian Ocean," an unnamed source was quoted as saying by Bernama. According to the report, Bangladesh stepped in after former Malaysian minister Samy Vellu, now the Special Envoy of Infrastructure to India and South Asia, requested for its help. Meanwhile, India has also stepped up its efforts to locate the ill-fated MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew.  More naval and air assets, including two recently-acquired P8I Long Range Maritime Patrol aircraft of the Indian Navy and one C130 J aircraft of the Indian Air Force, were deployed to scour an expanded area in the central and east Bay of Bengal, India's defence ministry said in a statement on Saturday. There were five Indian nationals on board MH370.
