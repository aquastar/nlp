A high number of Indian leaders have come forward to contest in the PKR party polls. PETALING JAYA: Poor representation for Indians within PKR has more Indian leaders contesting in the coming party polls, says K Gunasekaran, central committee candidate. Speaking to FMT, Gunasekaran said the present leaders like Xavier Jayakumar, N Surendran and R Sivarasa had not performed in the best of interest for the Indian community, thus more Indian leaders are coming forward to stand for top positions. He said that it was time to seriously voice and champion the Indian issues through PKR and not only act as a party that entice votes during elections and by-elections. Gunasekaran who also stands for Hulu Selangor division chief vowed to bring a change not only for the Indian community but for the other races as well with a true reformation agenda. PKR veep candidate R Suresh Kumar said that this time around more Indians have come forward to look for a true change and put a strong base to voice for the Indians within the party. Yesterdayâ€™s nomination saw Puchong division leader S Murali and Batang Kali PKR leader K Ramachandram going for deputy president. For the veep position, five Indian leaders will be battling in a 16 cornered fight. They are incumbent veep Surendran, former Federal Territories deputy chief Suresh Kumar, Petaling Jaya leader Streram Sinnasamy, Sri Andalas assemblyman Xavier Jeyakumar and Batu member N ShanmugamFor the central committee around 35 Indians will be contesting from a total of 71 contestants, which comprise almost 50 per cent. Meanwhile, PKR vice-president and Subang MP Sivarasa when asked the reason for not contesting said that since there were a lot of other leaders contesting, he decided not to contest this time around. The candidates have until April 10 to withdraw.  PKR allows its members to directly elect office bearers.  Elections will be conducted from April 26 to May 11.
