KAJANG: The results of the full review on the School-Based Assessment (PBS) system will be announced tomorrow, Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said. He said one of the significant improvements to be made on the system was to spare teachers from having to key in their students’ performance data into the PBS online system. Muhyiddin, who is also Education Minister, said another improvement proposed by approximately 1,000 teachers involved in the review was that teachers need not attach any evidence and should only keep the data offline. “These data should only be provided upon request from parents.  Details about these improvements will be announced on March 18,” he said when addressing the audience at the Parents-Teachers Involvement Programme at Kajang High School, here yesterday. On Feb 23, Education Ministry director-general Datuk Dr Khair Mohamad Yusof announced the postponement of the implementation of the PBS system to make way for a full review and improvement. Muhyiddin said although some teachers opined that the PBS system was a good system and should be continued, the ministry had made a comprehensive decision and had postponed the implementation for mutual benefit. He said the ministry was not only aware of the problems faced by the teachers, but also understood the anger and dissatisfaction of husbands of teachers who claimed that the implementation of the system had limited their wives’ time for the family. “That is why we are postponing the system for improvement…I also understand that teachers must be teaching, not only keying in data,” he added.  — Bernama
