The missing Malaysia Airlines plane made a U-turn near where it was last logged by air traffic controllers and was tracked for an hour by military radar. The jet bound for Beijing vanished 40 minutes after take-off from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board on Friday. But a military source revealed the plane was detected near Pulau Perak, an island in the Malacca Strait, 500km (300 miles) off its planned course. The source said it was flying at a lower altitude when it was spotted by military radar.  The development appears to rule out the theory that flight MH370 suffered ‘sudden catastrophic mechanical failure’. No distress signal or message was sent and the new sighting indicates that the plane’s transponder was either switched off or had stopped working. The development has seen the search area for wreckage widened greatly. In the US, CIA director John Brennan said the possibility that the plane had been brought down in a terrorist attack could not be ruled out. But he said no ‘claims of responsibility’ over the missing jet had been ‘confirmed or corroborated’. As Malaysian police confirmed they were carrying out psychological profiles of everyone on board the jet, Mr Brennan also refused to rule out a theory that the pilot may have committed suicide. Earlier, Interpol revealed that two passengers travelling on stolen passports – named as Pouria Nourmohammadi Mehrdad, 19, and 29-year-old Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar – were Iranians with no links to terrorism. Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines said it was investigating an Australian TV report that alleged that missing co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid allowed South African tourists Jonti Roos and Jaan Maree to stay in the cockpit during a Phuket to Kuala Lumpur flight two years ago. ‘Throughout the flight he was smoking, which I don’t think he is allowed to do,’ said Ms Roos. In a further development, an airline official called the mobile numbers of missing crew and they rang out.
