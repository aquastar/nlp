"Everyone has a role to play, according to a SOP that is used internationally. "All of us are working around the clock and we will to continue to perform this duty," he said. He said the embassy is offering consular assistance to families of affected passengers. As of Tuesday noon, a total of 73 visas have been issued to Chinese family members of affected passengers, and Iskandar promised that the visa office would be working around the clock to handle the visa applications. A prayer session would be arranged at the embassy. On the 10 countries that have lent a helping hand in the search and rescue mission, Iskandar said the assistance has proven the good bilateral relations between Malaysia and other nations. MAS commercial director Dr Hugh Dunleavy said the airlines' priority is to take care of the families here. "We promise that they will be the first to be informed whenever we have verified information.  Our commitment is to only provide verified info. "Many news sources around the world presented information as if it is true, raising the expectations of the families. "When we come in to tell them the info has not been verified, they get angry at us for telling the truth," he said. Firefly CEO Ignatius Ong added that the human spirit is strong amid these trying times. "It cuts across race and religion, we all work together towards a level that we couldn't even believe we can do," he said.
