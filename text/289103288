Under pressure from reports that the plane flew as far west as the Strait of Malacca, Malaysian Air Force Chief General Rodzali Daud issued a written statement Wednesday denying that he told the local press that the plane had last been see in the vicinity of Pulau Perak, an island in the Strait, at 2:40 p. m.  before its signal disappeared without a trace. Gen.  Rodzali referred to earlier statements and said they were still valid, that the air force hadn’t ruled out the possibility of a turn back before the aircraft vanished from the radar, resulting in the search area being widened.  The statement described the report as “inaccurate and incorrect. ”The statement said that the air force was “examining and analyzing all possibilities as regards to the airliner’s flight paths subsequent to its disappearance” and was aiming for certainty and verification.  Search operations were being conducted to cover all possible areas where the aircraft could have gone down. The statement didn’t give details of how long the plane might have flown westward or where it was last spotted. A senior Air Force officer separately said that “the military radar showed that the aircraft tried to turn back, and some civilian radar picked that up as well, that’s why we’re searching the west of the peninsula, just in case. ”
