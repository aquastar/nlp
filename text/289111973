Malaysian police say one of the passengers using a stolen passport on the missing Malaysian Airlines jetliner was an Iranian asylum-seeker. It was reported earlier today that tickets purchased on the missing flight MH370 by two passengers using fake passports were issued in Thailand to an Iranian man. Thai police say the two tickets were bought on Thursday from two tour agencies in the Pattaya beach resort. According to the Bangkok Post, citing an unnamed employee, both tickets were ordered via email by a man named “Ali’’ from Iran. Pattaya Police Chief Colonel Suphachai Phuikaewkham said “Ali’’ had called from a private number in Iran. The tour agency said “Ali’’ was a regular customer, and had originally asked for tickets on Etihad Airlines or Qatar Airways flying to Copenhagen and Frankfurt.  He later switched to China Southern Airlines, which has a code share agreement with Malaysia Airlines, because they were cheaper, the Bangkok Post said. Both tickets were paid for in Thai baht by another Iranian national who runs a picture-framing business in Pattaya, said Colonel Suphachai. “We’ve questioned him but didn’t find anything suspicious about him,’’ Suphachai said.  “It’s too early to say if this is a case involving terrorists,’’ he added. Five passengers who checked in for Flight MH370 didn’t board the plane, and their luggage was removed from it, Malaysian authorities said.  Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said this also was being investigated, but he didn’t say whether this was suspicious.
