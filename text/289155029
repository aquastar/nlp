Interpol said yesterday that the two passengers who used stolen passports to board the Malaysian flight were Iranian seeking asylum in Europe. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished from radar screens early Saturday local time with 239 people on board, shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. Interpol Secretary General Ronald K.  Noble identified the men as Pouri Nourmohammadi, 19, and Delavar Seyedmohammaderza, 29 and released a photograph of the two men boarding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, at the same time said that the two men had traveled to Malaysia from Tehran using Iranian passports, but had secured stolen Italian and Austrian passports in Kuala Lumpur for their journey to Beijing and Amsterdam, for which both had tickets and planned to travel together. Two Iranians known to have used stolen passports to board the Malaysia Airlines jet were unlikely to be linked to terrorist groups, international police authorities said, echoing an assessment by the Malaysian police that one of them was a 19-year-old who wanted to migrate to Germany. Interpol identified the second Iranian traveler as Seyed Mohammed Reza Delavar, 29,who used a stolen Italian passport. The 19-year-old, Pouria Nourmohammadi Mehrdad, was using a stolen Austrian passport to travel to Germany, where he was to meet his mother, said Khalid Abu Bakar, the inspector general of the Malaysian police. “We are in contact with his mother,” Mr.  Khalid said at a news conference. In the meantime a BBC Persian language editor told Britain's Daily Telegraph that the Iranians were "looking for a place to settle. " He added that both Malaysia and Thailand are home to large Iranian communities.
