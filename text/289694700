The search operations involving five warships and six surveillance aircraft have been put on hold and ˈwe are awaiting fresh instructions from Malaysia,ˈ pti reported quoting Andaman and Nicobar Command spokesperson Colonel Harmit Singh. The Coast Guard and the Navy have deployed six warships along with the ICGS Sagar which will conduct searches in the Malacca Straits.   India was carrying out searches in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal in area roughly around 2. 5 lakh km.  Malaysia yesterday said the movement of the missing Flight MH370 with 239 people on board was ˈconsistent with deliberate action by someone on planeˈ.  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak had said that authorities are now trying to trace the plane across two possible corridors - in the north to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern corridor from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.  The Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200 mysteriously disappeared from radar screens an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on March 8.  The jetliner was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members.  There has been no trace of the plane nor any sign of wreckage despite a search by the navies and military aircraft of 14 countries, involving 43 ships and 58 aircraft.   2160**1422
