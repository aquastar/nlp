According to Deadline. com, a scene from the show was aired as an epilogue as a goodbye to the character. Late Marcia Wallace who had voiced Edna in more than 175 episodes had also won an Emmy for it. Better known as Mrs.  K by her students, the character had made the debut in the show in its first season, nearly a quarter-century ago.  (ANI)
