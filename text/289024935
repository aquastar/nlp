A Dubai resident has arrived in Beijing to await news of her son and daughter-in-law who are listed as two of the 239 passengers listed on board the Malaysia Airlines aircraft which went missing on Saturday, it was reported. Uma Mukherjee travelled from her home in the UAE to the Chinese capital after it was confirmed her son Muktesh Mukherjee and his wife Xiaomao Bai were listed as passengers on missing Flight MH370. The 47-year-old Canadian-Indian businessman is vice-president of operations in China for the Pennsylvania-based XCoal Energy and Resources and was travelling with his 37-year-old Chinese wife when the flight left Kuala Lumpar on Saturday morning and disappeared off the coast of Vietnam en route to Beijing. “We are trying to gather information and get the family together.  It’s a very sad time for us,” a Mukherjee family relative was quoted as telling the UK-based Daily Mail newspaper. It is not the first time the family has been impacted by an aviation disaster.  Uma’s father, Indian politician Mohan Kumaramangalam, who was a minister in Indira Gandhi’s government, was killed in 1973 when an Indian Airlines flight crashed close to New Delhi, killing all 65 passengers on board. “We’re living in fear of a second disaster in the air in our family,” a Mukherjee family member told India's The Telegraph newspaper. Investigators in Malaysia are voicing skepticism that the missing aircraft was the target of an attack, US and European government sources close to the probe told Reuters. The fate of the aircraft remained a mystery, as a massive air and sea search, now in its third day, failed to turn up any trace of the Boeing 777 plane. Neither Malaysia's Special Branch, the agency leading the investigation locally, nor spy agencies in the United States and Europe have ruled out the possibility that militants may have been involved in downing Malaysia Airlines Flight.
