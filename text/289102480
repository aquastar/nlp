BEIJING - The genuine friendship between Malaysia and China is demonstrated in these trying times, said the Malaysian Prime Minister's special envoy to China, Tan Sri Ong Ka Ting. Ong, who was sent here by Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, had a meeting with China's Vice-Foreign Minister Xie Hangsheng yesterday. "Xie commented that our actions, including the Prime Minister's direct communication with Chinese PreÂ­mier Li Keqiang, and the search and rescue mission, are practical and sincere.  These have proven the strong and amicable friendship between China and Malaysia," said Ong. Ong added that he was here to inform the Chinese government that Malaysia is fully committed in the search and rescue mission. "We promise the Chinese government that we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to locate MH370," he said. Ong had also requested the Chinese government to give full cooperation to relevant Malaysian authorities and Malaysia Airlines in providing assistance to the affected families. In Kuala Lumpur, China's ambassador to Malaysia, Huang Huikang, said China is satisfied at the smooth and orderly manner in which authorities here have been handling the search and rescue operations. Although there were some criticism from certain quarters in China, Huang said he had opportunity to see first hand how the authorities here swung into action to coordinate search and rescue operations. "I had the experience on the first day when I was invited by the Prime Minister and Defence Minister to receive reports from different departments and agencies," he said after making a courtesy call on Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Pandikar Amin Mulia yesterday.
