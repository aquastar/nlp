MORE than 70 members of a friendship club in Kajang staged a protest against a Facebook user over a posting that allegedly insulted the people of Kelantan over the missing MH370 craft, Sinar Harian reported. The protesters, largely originating from the east coast state, said that the posting by one Shariman Omar was an unnecessary provocation in the midst of a national crisis and sorrow. Kelab Sahabat Putra Kajang treasurer Sabaruddin Zakaria, 40, said on Monday that they had lodged a police report against the FB user and also demanded that he retract his remarks and make a public apology to the people of Kelantan. Club committee member Mohd Sufian Mat Junus, 39, said that the FB user had habitually insulted Kelantan since a month ago. “It is the kind of provocation that can create chaos among the people of Kelantan, who do not have any quarrel with anybody. “We hope the authorities will nab him and charge him under the relevant laws,” he said. > Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) will take stern action against traders­ who employ foreign workers,­ Harian Metro reported.
