With the mystery of the disappearance of a Malaysian airliner growing for a third day, aviation analysts speculated Monday that a catastrophic event such as a bomb blast or mechanical failure brought down the Boeing 777 over the dense jungles of Vietnam. But they and government officials continued to say that it is too early to draw a conclusion and that an act of terrorism hasn’t been ruled out. “There isn’t anything that isn’t strange about this accident,” said Jim Tilmon, a retired American Airlines pilot.  “There’s so many things that could’ve happened.  We need to be careful about jumping to conclusions because one of the things we do know is that early information is often wrong. ”Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished from radar screens and radio contact at 35,000 feet Saturday en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.  No debris has been found off the coast of Thailand, where the water is shallow. A key element of the mystery is how all of the airliner’s electronic emissions went silent simultaneously. A variety of electronic transmissions usually help flight controllers and investigators track a plane’s altitude, direction and speed.  Transponders, automatic beacons, GPS and computer communications help monitor the state-of-the-art Boeing 777.  The plane’s “black box” transmissions are activated by the impact of a downed flight.  This time, no problems were reported before everything went black.
