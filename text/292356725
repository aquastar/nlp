KUALA LUMPUR: Police have arrested the person who allegedly uploaded a doctored picture of Prime Minister's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor on Facebook. City police deputy CID chief Asst Comm Khairi Ahrasa said Syed Ahmad Saifullah Hashim, 28, who worked in a launderette, was arrested after police raided a house at 12. 10am Sunday in Bandar Universiti Seri Iskandar, in Tronoh, Perak. He said police also seized a handphone, a computer and several other gadgets that were believed to be involved in the case. "We believe that with the arrest, we have solved the case," he said, adding that the suspect had been remanded until March 8 for investigation. ACP Khairi said the case was being investigated under Section 505 of the Penal Code and 233 (1) of the Multimedia Communications Act. The picture depicted a mangled body, purportedly a passenger of a plane crash, with Rosmah's face superimposed on it.
