Early on Nov 19, 1985, the Malaysian police under the direction of the home minister laid siege to a house in the Kedah village of Memali in which PAS leader Ibrahim Libya (Ibrahim Mahmood) and his comrades were staying in a bid to resist arrest under the Internal Security Act (ISA).   There were no lengthy negotiations with the besieged and by noon 14 men, including Ibrahim Libya, lay dead.  Four police personnel also died, apparently as a result of friendly fire and several of the survivors were arrested under the ISA.   Certainly this 1985 massacre at Memali shares the same moral shame as the 1948 Batang Kali massacre, when 24 innocent villagers were mowed down by British troops at Batang Kali.
