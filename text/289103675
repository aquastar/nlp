KUALA LUMPUR: Interpol has confirmed the identity of another Iranian who boarded Malaysia Airlines (MAS) aircraft MH370 which disappeared last Saturday, while using a false Italian passport. He made the announcement at a press conference in France which was aired by CNN news yesterday. Earlier in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar had revealed the identity of an Iranian, Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, 19, who was believed to be enroute to Germany to seek asylum, while using an Austrian passport. Khalid said the teen was not linked to any terror group, adding that his mother had contacted the Malaysian authorities when he failed to arrive in Frankfurt. Noble said the two men travelled to Malaysia on their Iranian passports, then apparently switched to the stolen Austrian and Italian documents. On March 8, the Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200ER aircraft with 227 passengers and 12 crew members went off the radar at 1. 30am, about an hour after taking off from the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The authorities had earlier revealed the two men had boarded the MAS aircraft using false passports which were reported stolen in Thailand, several years ago.  â€” Bernama
