BAGAN DATOH: Anyone who loses the MyKad through negligence risks a fine of up to RM500, says Home Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. However, he said the fine would not be imposed on those who lost the identification document during natural disasters. "In the case of identity cards lost through negligence, first-time offenders will be fined RM100, and this amount will increase to up to RM500 for second-time offenders," he told reporters after a gotong-royong session to repair the home of a senior citizen in Kampung Parit 21, here, Saturday. Currently, the fine is RM100 for a first-time offender, RM200 for repeat offender and RM300 for subsequent losses. Ahmad Zahid said to date, about 500,000 MyKad documents had been reported stolen. "The Government is concerned for those who lost their identity cards.  However, we feel they should pay a fine accordingly, so that they do not lose the document again," he said. In a separate development, Ahmad Zahid said the Foreign Workers Centralised Management System would be re-structured to speed up the application process for foreign workers. He said, for now, the intake of foreign workers was through three channels, namely, the one-stop centre which included various departments and agencies; the ministry's foreign worker intake department and the immigration department's foreign workers division. He said applications would no longer be made through foreign labour agencies but employers could apply directly online to a channel, which would be determined by a special committee on foreign labour, to be headed by Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. Ahmad Zahid said he would be visiting labour-supplying countries to simplify the procedure for the intake of foreign workers and send back those whose work permits had expired.
