Two Japanese companies have agreed deals to develop advanced coal-fired power plants in Malaysia and Myanmar as part of a government drive to export energy efficiency technology to emerging markets, a report said Sunday. The Japanese government is seeking to promote the export of ultra-supercritical (USC) pressure technology power plants to meet expected growing demand in emerging economies, the Nikkei business daily said. USC power plants are the most efficient in the world, generating hotter, higher-pressure steam than conventional units resulting in significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions, Nikkei said. Japanese trading firm Mitsui has agreed to oversee the construction and operation of a plant in Malaysia with two USC generators that can each produce one million kilowatts of energy, the daily said. Mitsui, partnering with government-affiliated infrastructure group 1Malaysia Development Berhad, is expected to sign a formal contract with the Malaysian government by this summer, Nikkei said. The project is valued at about 360 billion yen (about $3. 48 billion) and come online in 2018.  Under the plan, Toshiba (Frankfurt: TSE1. F - news) will deliver steam turbines to the plant to be built in Jimah, south of Kuala Lumpur, while Japanese heavy equipment maker IHI (Frankfurt: IWJ. F - news) will provide boilers, Nikkei said. In addition, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking has reached a deal to extend loans for a 260 billion yen USC power generation project in Myanmar, the daily said. Japanese heavy machinery makers will take part in the construction of the plant with an output of 1. 28 million kilowatts in cooperation with Thai engineering firm Toyo-Thai Corporation Public Co. , it said. The two companies will start the construction by the end of the year and aim to start the plant in 2018.
