The airline that serves Malaysia and Southwest Asia is pulling its April inflight magazine because of an article that promises passengers its planes “would never get lost. ”Mirror Online reported that AirAsia apologized for its current issue of Travel 3Sixty, which includes an article boasting about how well-trained its pilots are. AirAsia Executive Chairman Kamarudin Meranun said the magazine was printed before the Malaysia Airlines plane carrying 239 people disappeared March 8 while headed from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The article was reportedly a monthly aviation column by a retired pilot who had worked for AirAsia and Malaysia Airlines. A photo of the article sparked anger after being posted on Twitter on Friday. AirAsia group CEO Tony Fernandes said the magazine was pulled as soon as the company was informed about it.  The company has since apologized.
