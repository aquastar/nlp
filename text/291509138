Over the Indian Ocean, members of the Royal Australian Air Force are scratching their heads, looking for any trace of a missing Malaysia Airlines plane.  Flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared weeks ago with more than 200 on board.  It's presumed to have crashed west of Perth in one of the most remote locations on earth.  Still, no tangible evidence of the missing plane.  But four orange objects could be a lead says Flight Lieutenant Russell Adams.  ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE FLIGHT LIEUTENANT RUSSELL ADAMS SAYING: "We were able to detect many objects in the water today, we were able to rule a few out as fishing buoys and fishing nets.  However, of interest today we did encounter an area within approximately 500 nautical miles, included at least four orange colored objects, greater than approximately 2 meters in size each.  I must stress that we can't confirm the origin of these objects, however the details of these in association with a GPS buoy have been passed on to our rescue coordination center. " Although it's mainly fish nets for now.  The clock is ticking in the hunt -- with the Malaysian airliner's black box just days from running out of batteries.
