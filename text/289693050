KAJANG: Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin has urged the people to set aside their differences and support the authorities’ efforts in the search for the missing MH370 aircraft. The Deputy Prime Minister said Malaysians should come together and stand united in these challenging times. “We need to rally behind the authorities who have been working non-stop since the Malaysia Airlines flight was reported missing,” he said at a session with representatives of various non-governmental organisations here yesterday. “This is not the time to argue about our different stand or beliefs, about who is right or wrong.  This is the time when our country needs us to be as one. ”To the families of the 239 passengers and crew on board the missing Beijing-bound flight, Muhyiddin hoped that they would remain strong and positive. “Let me assure you that the Government is doing all it can to track the missing plane with the help of our friends and allies,” he added. In Shah Alam, Selangor Mentri Besar Tan Sri Khalid Ibrahim urged the public to be mindful when commenting on the missing plane. He refused to be drawn into news reports that MH370 pilot Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a strong supporter of PKR adviser Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. “We must give the family and the rest space and I would not want to say anything except to pray for the return of MH370,” he added. Police sources reportedly told Mail Online that Zaharie was a vocal political activist and that the court verdict in Anwar’s sodomy trial had upset him.  On Saturday, police searched Zaharie’s house in Shah Alam and took away his homemade flight simulator for investigation.
