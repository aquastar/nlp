The mystery over the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner has not affected foreign investors confidence on the country's security, said Deputy International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Hamim. He said on the contrary, business confidence and outlook among foreign investors had climbed due to the government efficiency in coordinating the search and rescue operation involving a number of countries. "There is no reason why foreign investors could have lost confidence in our security as Malaysia has won praises over the handling of the missing flight MH370," he told reporters after attending a seminar on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Johor today. He said attempts by certain quarters to undermine Malaysia over social media had not eroded foreign investors confidence as they were aware of the conducive investment environment created by the government. Earlier in his speech, he ticked off the opposition for calling for the prime minister to resign for the delay in announcing the disappearance of the aircraft. Hamim said the government could not announce the developments of the ensuing search for the plane until it received accurate and collaborated information to prevent repercussions that could tarnish its image.  – Bernama, March 16, 2014
