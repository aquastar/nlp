The Chinese Academy of Sciences has detected three oil slicks in waters around the search sites for the missing Malaysian plane. Its Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth collected satellite data taken on Saturday and Monday from the search sites.  The Institute has submitted the results of satellite analysis to relevant departments, hoping to provide more information to the search efforts. The Institute started an emergency plan on Saturday, and has applied to use the satellite data in the following three days.
