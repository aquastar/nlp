Holding up banners that read "you must return relatives of MH370, no strings attached" and "Hand us the murderer.  Tell us the truth.  Give us our relatives back", several dozen Chinese relatives of passengers staged a protest at a hotel near Kuala Lumpur just hours after flying in from Beijing. Two-thirds of the 227 passengers aboard the Malaysia Airlines plane that disappeared March 8 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur were Chinese, and many of the relatives have denounced Malaysia's handling of the search for the jet. They repeatedly chanted slogans in Chinese: "We want evidence! We want the truth! We want our relatives!"Jiang Hui, the relatives' designated representative, said they wanted the Malaysian government to apologise for what they see as missteps in the initial handling of the disaster as well as Prime Minister Najib Razak's earlier statement that indicated the plane had crashed with no survivors. Mr Jiang said the relatives felt the conclusion was announced without sufficient evidence. He said the group wanted to meet airline and government officials, although he stopped short of saying that included Mr Najib, as earlier proposed by some relatives. Mr Najib went on television on March 24 to say that based on radar and satellite analysis the plane had crashed somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, but there were lingering questions because there was no physical evidence. It has been 22 days since the plane went missing and so far none of the recovered debris has been linked to MH370.
