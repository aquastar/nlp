Malaysia is sending a six-member delegation to China to ease ruffled feathers over the missing MAS flight MH370SEPANG: A six-member delegation, believed to be from Beijing, arrived at the KL International Airport (KLIA) here today, most probably in relation to the missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) aircraft. The delegation members arrived at 8am and were escorted to a special room before leaving the airport in a China embassy vehicle at 9. 30am. They declined to be interviewed by the local and foreign reporters who had been waiting at the airport since early morning. The media was unable to get details about the delegation. Yesterday, 10 government officials from China arrived to assist Malaysia to conduct an investigation into the disappearance of Flight MH370. The Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, went off the radar at 1. 30am on Saturday, about anÂ hour after departing KLIA. The plane was carrying passengers from 14 countries, with more than half of them Chinese nationals and 38 Malaysians. Meanwhile, MAS Group chief executive officer Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said search and rescue teams have expanded the scope beyond the MH370 flight path in the West Peninsular of Malaysia involving search on sea and land as the authorities are looking at the possibility the aircraft made a turn back to Subang.
