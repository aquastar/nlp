The cities of Makati and Pasig in Metro Manila have emerged as “Selfie Capital of the World”, according to TIME Magazine. “An examination of hundreds of thousands of selfies—the low-fi, self-shot photographs that are intensely popular among younger social media users—suggests that the city, part of metropolitan Manila and home to 500,000 people, produces more selfies per capita than any other city in the world,” said TIME editor Chris Wilson . The two cities posted 258 self-takers per 100,000 people, making it number one in the list of 459 cities evaluated by the magazine. In its Twitter account, the Makati City government said the tag was “not surprising. . .  on work days Makati has around 3 million cellphone-equipped office employees, shoppers and visitors. ”The magazine ranked Cebu City number 9 in the list with an average of 99 selfie-takers for every 100,000 people. Joining Makati and Pasig are Manhattan, New York (202); Miami, Florida (155); Anaheim and Santa Ana, California (147); Petaling Jaya, Malaysia (141); Tel Aviv, Israel (139); Manchester, England (114); Milan, Italy (108); Cebu City (99); and George Town, Malaysia (95). The study was made on January 28 to February 2, 2014 and March 3 to 7, 2014.  The selfie tagged 402,197 Instagram photos within a 24-hour period. The TIME magazine, however, noted that the data “only account for a fraction of all selfies uploaded during that time since the majority of photos do not include a location” along with smartphone adoption rates and media income among other factors. “For every city in the world of at least 250,000 residents, we then counted the number of selfies taken within 5 miles and divided by the population of that city,” it said.
