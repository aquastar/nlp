A U. S.  satellite operator is using crowdsourcing to assist in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. DigitalGlobe Inc.  has deployed two of its five satellites to fly over several of the search zones in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, allowing volunteers to look for any evidence of the missing jet on an online platform. A satellite is due to make another pass over the region around 10 a. m.  local time on Wednesday, including the northern end of the Strait of Malacca after Malaysia Airlines said the locality was now part of the search area. Luke Barrington, senior manager for geospatial big data at DigitalGlobe, said fresh images of the Strait of Malacca should be available early Wednesday U. S.  time. A multinational force is continuing its search efforts in other areas. The initial images were viewed by 100,000 volunteers who examined each pixel 100 times over, said Mr.  Barrington. None was able to detect any signs of the fate of the Boeing Co.  777-200ER or its passengers and crew. Mr.  Barrington said the companyâ€™s own analysts decided where to focus its satellites, which normally provide images for governments and commercial customers. This choice reflected official guidance and media reports, avoiding areas already covered by other commercial satellites or where poor weather would prevent collection of useful data.
