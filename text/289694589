• Bombing still being considered as cause• Plane changed course seven hours before fallingNew leads are being followed in the Malaysian Airlines missing plane incident following recent investigations. Analysts are now saying the passenger jet may have been blown out of the sky, in a similar incident to the Lockerbie, Scotland disaster in 1988. At that time a Pan Am jumbo jet was bombed, raining deadly wreckage onto the population below. Air India Flight 182 was also blown up off the coast of Ireland in the 1980's. Senior officials in Malaysia have suggested evidence so far indicates that flight MH370 disintegrated at around 35,000 feet. Those involved in the probe of the disappearance of the Boeing 777, have told Reuters they cannot be sure that foul play caused the plane to blow up. While they have not ruled out hijacking, they have said a mechanical fault could also have broken the plane apart. On Friday Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak said the communications systems on the flight were "deliberately disabled. "Satellite and radar evidence, he said, had shown that the plane changed its course before flying onward for up to seven hours in "movements consistent with the deliberate action of someone on the plane". The plane disappeared a week ago with 239 people on board. Only four weeks ago an Ethiopian Airlines co-pilot hijacked his own plane to seek political asylum in Switzerland. On Friday, Malaysian police raided the homes of the pilot and co-pilot of the missing Malaysian plane to glean any information about their mental states. There are still no obvious suspects for a terrorism theory with most insurgents in the area without the capability of carrying through such a plan.
