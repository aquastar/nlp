KUALA LUMPUR: DAP national chairman Karpal Singh’s conviction for sedition will not affect his practice as a lawyer, said the Malaysian Bar. Its president Christopher Leong said the Bar had consistently been against the Sedition Act over many decades. Karpal maintained that his position as Member of Parliament would not be affected following the High Court ruling to fine him RM4,000 for sedition. “As far as I am concerned, I keep doing my duty as MP.  Barisan Nasional must be prepared to answer to the people in Bukit Gelugor constituency,” he told reporters after the court proceeding here yesterday. Asked if this was the worst day of his life as an MP, Karpal said he was calm, adding that he had been doing it since 1978. On the sentencing, Karpal said: “Today is something that we must be prepared for. ”Some other leader, said Karpal, could take over his position if he would not be able to continue with his service. “Unless there is a coup d’etat, I remain DAP chairman,” he said. Opposition leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim expressed his disgust and disappointment with the court’s decision. “I heard the prosecution speak and it was very shocking,” said Anwar. Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng said watching Karpal’s sentencing brought back sad memories of his own conviction for sedition, which saw him jailed 12 months. “I felt like the nightmare has come back,” he added.
