Our primary focus at this point in time is to care for the families of the passengers and crew of MH370.  This means providing them with timely information, travel facilities, accommodation, meals, medical and emotional support. Malaysia Airlines is fully aware of the on-going media speculations and we have nothing further to add to the information we have already provided. Malaysia Airlines reiterates that we will continue to give our full support in cooperating with the search and rescue mission which is coordinated by the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia (DCA) under the purview of the Ministry of Transport, Malaysia. Q    And on the missing Malaysian plane, there had been some reporting that U. S.  investigators have received some type of indication that the plane may have flew for another four hours or so after it was last -- sent a signal about where it was.   There now seems to be some questions about the veracity of those reports.   Can you provide any clarity about what U. S.  investigators have been able to determine about that?MR.  CARNEY:  I can tell you that the investigation is ongoing and it is being led by the Malaysian government.   U. S.  air safety officials are in Kuala Lumpur working closely with the Malaysian government on the investigation. There are a number of possible scenarios that are being investigated as to what happened to the flight, and we are not in a position at this time to make conclusions about what happened, unfortunately.   But we’re actively participating in the search.   And, again, we, in an investigation led by the Malaysian government -- an investigation that involves many nations with many assets -- are following leads where we find them.   And it’s my understanding that based on some new information that’s not necessarily conclusive, but new information, an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean, and we are consulting with international partners about the appropriate assets to deploy. But I don’t have anything more on that at this time.   It’s obviously an ongoing investigation, and one that has not produced conclusive results.   And it’s frustrating for everyone, but agonizing for the families of those passengers on the flight.   And our thoughts and prayers go out to them especially because this is truly agonizing for them. Q    Just to follow on one thing you said.   You said there may be a new area over the Indian Ocean?MR.  CARNEY:  Again, we’re looking at information, pursuing possible leads, working within the investigation being led by the Malaysian government.   And it is my understanding that one possible piece of information or collection of pieces of information has led to the possibility that a new area, a search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean.   But I don’t have any more details on that; Department of Defense might, and certainly the Malaysian government might.
