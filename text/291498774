JOHOR BARU: The sudden death of Kpl R.  Jothilingam has come as a shock to his former superior, Nusajaya OCPD Supt Noor Ha-shim Mohamed. He described the policeman as a disciplined man who always wore the blue uniform with integrity. Supt Noor Hashim added that Kpl Jothilingam, 32, was sta-tioned at the criminal investigation department unit of the district police from 2012 until he was transferred last month to Seri Alam police headquarters. “He always worked hard in performing his duties.  and I had the privilege of having him under my wing for two years before he was transferred to another district. “When Kpl Jothilingam was at the Nusajaya district police, he was well liked by his colleagues and his subordinate officers as well,” said Supt Noor Hashim after attending a blood donation drive programme here yesterday. He added that Kpl Jothilingam would be missed by the Nusajaya police force. “He had no disciplinary problems and had helped lower the crime rate in our district,” said Supt Noor Hashim. It was reported that police had found the body of the policeman at the Bandar Putra Kulai urban jungle on Friday. Kpl Jothilingam had contacted the Kulaijaya police district headquarters informing them that he wanted to shoot himself and cut off the call. He was from Kuala Lumpur and had been in the police force for the past 15 years. He had served at the Segamat and Nusajaya police district as well as the Johor police contingent headquarters. When contacted, Kulaijaya OCPD Supt Ruslan Khalid declined to comment further as investigations were still ongoing.
