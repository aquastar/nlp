PETALING JAYA: Tomnod, the online map site used by millions of netizens in the search for the missing flight MH370, has been expanded to the Straits of Malacca and the Indian Ocean. According to its Twitter handle, Tomnod uploaded on Saturday new high-resolution satellite images of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as well as parts of the Indian Ocean. This came as Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak confirmed that the missing Malaysia Airlines flight flew westwards across Peninsular Malaysia, with the plane going towards two possible route corridors covering vast amounts of sea. A multinational search-and-rescue operation for MH370 has shifted its focus from the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean, with the number of countries taking part now 25 in total. Managed by the US-based satellite company Digital Globe, Tomnod was said to have had more than 3 million participants, with more than 190 million map views since the MH370-specific online search was launched on March 10. Prior to Najib's announcement, Tomnod's search area covered 24,000 sq km of the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea.  Now, 14,000 sq km of the area west of Peninsular Malaysia has been added to the online service. "(The) search area is constantly changing as more info is coming to light," its Twitter handle said.
