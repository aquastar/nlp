SEPANG - Malaysia has requested support from at least 22 countries on general satellite data, radar playback - both primary and secondary - provisions for ground, sea and aerial search, and assets to help with the new search and rescue effort (SAR) and investigations into the missing MH370 flight. Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein said the nation had sought the help of countries that had satellite assets, including the US, China and France among others, to provide further satellite data to pinpoint the B777-200ER aircraft's location. He said the Foreign Ministry had briefed representatives from 22 countries, including those along the northern and southern search corridors, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia. "We are contacting additional countries who may be able to contribute specific assets relevant to the search and rescue operation," he told press conference here today. Present were Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar, Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) director-general Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, and Malaysia Airline chief executive officer (CEO) Ahmad Jauhari Yahya. Hishammuddin said Malaysia, who was leading the effort, which had now gone into its second phase, was discussing with its partners on how best to deploy assets along the two search corridors. "At this stage, both the northern and southern corridors are being treated with equal importance. "We are asking for surveillance aircraft and maritime vessels which are needed, particularly for the southern corridor. "
