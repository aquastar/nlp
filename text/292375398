KUCHING: The office of the Consulate General of the Republic of Indonesia at Jalan Stutong here was unusually busy yesterday. It was no ordinary Sunday as Indonesians made a beeline for early voting of their country’s general election. Indonesian General Election Committee Sarawak chairman Fathan Sutrisno said there were a total of 98,850 Indonesian registered voters in Sarawak, but they only target about 5,000 to come to vote at the consulate’s office here.  The voting process at the consulate took place from 8am to 5pm yesterday.  Indonesian citizens who are 17 years old and above are considered eligible voters and they are encouraged to exercise their voting rights. “Kuching is one of the six locations in Malaysia allocated by the Indonesian embassy for overseas voters to cast their ballots.  The voters also have other options to exercise their voting rights through ballot boxes at selected factories and plantations or sending over postal votes,” he said when met yesterday morning. Fathan said the ballot boxes from Kuching would be transferred to a tallying centre for the tallying process, which would begin on April 9.  The result of this election is scheduled to be known on April 15. Indonesians go the polls twice this year for both the parliamentary and presidential elections.  The parliamentary election proper is this Wednesday, April 9, but advanced voting for voters outside of Indonesia is held earlier. After that, Indonesians will vote again on July 9 for the presidential election.  The result of the parliamentary election is important because candidates for the presidency must be nominated by a party, or coalition, that secures at least 20 per cent of seats in parliament. The three parties that currently dominate parliament are President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s Partai Demokrat, Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan (PDI-P) led by former president Megawati Sukarnoputri and presidential hopeful Joko Widodo, and Aburizal Bakrie’s Golkar Party.
