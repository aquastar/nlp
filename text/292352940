KUALA LUMPUR: China has expressed appreciation over MCA’s assistance in the management of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 aircraft passengers’ families from that country. Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia, Dr Huang Hui Kang said Malaysia had, from the onset played a very vital role in the search and rescue (SAR) operation, having undertaken efforts to care for the next-of-kin of passengers from China. “We also contributed in managing any family member of passengers,  especially from our country, in the issuance of visas to Malaysia and are very appreciative of Malaysia’s efforts, especially those from the MCA, in sending volunteers to help the families over queries, in terms of moral support,” he said  at the mass prayers for the missing flight at Wisma MCA here yesterday. The MCA organised the mass prayers in collaboration with 16 Buddhist associations in Malaysia. MCA president Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai, his deputy, Datuk Wee Ka Siong and other party leaders, as well as nearly 300 Buddhist devotees attended the one-and-a-half hour prayer. On March 30, MCA deployed 48 members of its Crisis Relief Squad led by party vice-president Datin Paduka Chew Mei Fun to provide support and aid to 29 Chinese nationals’ next-of-kin who came to Malaysia. Chew, appointed by the Cabinet as the special envoy to assist the Chinese family members, met  Chinese officials in China from March 31 to April 1.   On the mass prayers, Huang said it was not just for the well-being of the MH370 passengers, but also for their families and parties involved in the SAR mission. Describing the search operations as a tough and challenging task,  he also expressed appreciation for Malaysia and 24 other countries in their continuous efforts to search for the missing aircraft.   — Bernama
