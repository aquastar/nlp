PUTRAJAYA: Counsellors from the Malaysian Crisis Intervention Team (MCIT) will visit the homes of family members of passengers and crew of MH370 and continue to provide guidance and counselling to them to cope with these difficult times. MCIT deputy chairman Dr Abdul Jalil Hassan said the new phase of counselling will begin soon and that family members could contact the Welfare Department offices nationwide so that counsellors could visit the homes of those in need of counselling. "Many of the next-of-kin are no longer staying at the hotel provided.  They have returned home to continue with their normal lives. "Therefore, we are entering a new phase whereby the MCIT will visit homes to continue to provide guidance and support," he told reporters when met at Everly Hotel today. Abdul said only five families were still staying at Everly Hotel. On the meeting of Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein with family members, he said it had a direct impact on the next-of-kin. "We are happy with the strategy employed (Hishammuddin's meeting with family members). "The families were also satisfied even if not all the questions were answered. " â€“ Bernama
