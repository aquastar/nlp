GEORGE TOWN: Penang may experience water rationing soon if the current dry spell continues. Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng said a decision on the matter will be made on Wednesday during the weekly state cabinet meeting. "A review will be conducted of water supplies and water reserves before coming to a conclusion," he said in statement today. The review comes after the Perak government imposed water rationing in Taiping, a town long considered to be the wettest in Malaysia due to regular rain. The prolonged dry season, said to be the longest in 15 years, has also resulted in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Johor starting water rationing. Lim, who is also Penang Water Supply Corporation (PWSC) chairman, expressed his disappointment over the rise in water consumption despite repeated advice and a water conservation surcharge. He said Penang last year consumed on average 295 cubic litres per person per day compared to the national average of 215 cubic litres per person per day. He said the amount rose by 5. 4% in the first three months of 2014 to 311 litres per person per day and urged people to conserve water. "Our water resources and reserves can be extended by another 50% if we conserve water and use the same amount as the national average," he added.
