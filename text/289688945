PETALING JAYA (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Opposition Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) leaders have dismissed a British tabloid report which claimed Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is a "political fanatic". PKR communications director Fahmi Fadzil said the Daily Mail report was "wild allegations" and the paper "is a sensationalist tabloid known for cooking up stories. "The tabloid claimed that Mr Zaharie commanded the doomed flight about several hours after he had attended the sodomy trial of opposition leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim on Friday. "These allegations are wild speculation for the moment," Mr Fahmi said.
