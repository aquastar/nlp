Iran is ready to share information on its citizens who used stolen passports to board missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday. "If we obtain additional information, we will share it with Malaysian authorities and the public," Merziye Afham said, adding that the country's ambassador in Malaysia contacted authorities for cooperation. The Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200, which had 227 passengers and 12 flight crew on board, went missing after losing contact with Malaysian and Vietnamese air traffic control some two hours after leaving Kuala Lumpur on Saturday. The two Iranians were identified Tuesday by Malaysian police and Interpol as 19-year-old Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad and 29-year-old Dilawar Syed Mohammed Reza. A check of the passenger list had revealed that the two men used passports stolen in Thailand from an Austrian and an Italian tourist in 2012 and 2013, respectively. There is no information linking the Iranian men with terror organizations. Up until now, there have been no signs of the plane, which has prompted an international Search-and-Rescue operation involving ten countries. Meanwhile, Malaysian Airlines announced Tuesday that they had expanded their search for the missing aircraft to West Malaysia and the Straits of Malacca after military radar readings suggested that the plane had “turned back. ”
