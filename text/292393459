PERTH: As the search for a missing Malaysian airliner entered its 30th day yesterday, the Australian Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) said it could not as yet confirm that a pulse signal detected in the southern Indian Ocean by a Chinese vessel came from the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight, MH370. JACC chief coordinator Air Chief Marshal (Rtd) Angus Houston said the electronic pulse signal reportedly detected by Haixun 01 ‘could not be verified at this point of time’. “I have been advised that a series of sounds have been detected by a Chinese ship in the search area. “The characteristics reported are consistent with an aircraft black box,” he said in a statement. He also said that a number of white objects were also reportedly sighted on the surface of the sea about 90 kilometres from where the signal was detected. “However, there is no confirmation at this stage that the signal and the objects are related to the missing aircraft,” he said. Houston said he would provide updates if and when more information became available.  — Bernama
