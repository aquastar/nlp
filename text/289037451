KUALA LUMPUR - A man travelling with a stolen passport on a missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner was an Iranian teenager trying to migrate illegally to Germany, and is not believed to have any terrorist links, police said Tuesday. Reporters take pictures as Malaysian police officials, centre and right, display photographs of one of the two men who boarded missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 using stolen European passports, at a press conference near Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang on Wednesday.

Police said a second passenger also travelling with a stolen passport has not been identified.  Both obtainedÂ their tickets from the same sales agent in Pattaya, Thailand, at the same time and entered Malaysia together.
