KUALA LUMPUR: The Petaling District will be the Health Ministry's focus to combat dengue with it recording 60% of dengue cases in Selangor. Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S.  Subramaniam said a programme is being drawn up to find and destroy the breeding places of the Aedes mosquitos. Speaking to reporters after launching the " Zero Dengue" campaign at the Taman Sejahtera Flats today, he said, Selangor topped the list with 13,915 dengue cases between Jan 1 and March 29 this year, making up 56 per cent of the total number of cases in the country. During that period, the country recorded 24,917 dengue cases with 58 deaths as compared with 6,100 dengue cases with 14 deaths during the same period last year. "During the same period this year, the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya registered 2,253 dengue cases with four deaths," he said. Subramaniam said 1,073,958 premises were inspected for Aedes breeding grounds and 2,699 compound fines totalling RM1,349,500 were imposed up to March 15 this year. The minister stressed the need for the people to be proactive and initiate efforts to fight the dengue menace by destroying the breeding grounds of the Aedes mosquito. "We know of many common places where the Aedes mosquito tend to breeds.  For example, clean water collected inside and outside the house as well as containers where we least expect to find the mosquito, such as toilets, flower pots, drains and ditches," he said.
