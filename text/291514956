Angry family members of Chinese passengers on board the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 demanded an apology from the Malaysian government as they urged Kuala Lumpur to release all related information. Chanting "we want proof, we want our families, we want the truth" at a press briefing on Sunday, they complained that they have not received any useful information from a high-level Malaysia team in Beijing. "We want Malaysia to apologise for the delay in the rescue," said a spokesman surnamed Jiang. Mr Jiang also said the families wanted Prime Minister Najib Razak to apologise for arriving at the conclusion that the plane had crashed without good evidence. The families also asked for meetings with Boeing, British Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and the statellite companies involved in the investigations.  They wanted MAS and the Malaysian government to help arrange the meetings on their behalf. Thirty-seven family members of Chinese passengers on board MH370 arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Sunday morning. They were brought to the Subang Holiday Villa Hotel and were greeted by Prime Minister's Special Envoy to China Tan Sri Ong Ka Ting and Malaysian Chinese Association vice-president Chew Mei Fun. China's ambassador to Malaysia Dr Huang Huikang met them in a closed-door meeting after they arrived at the hotel. They had asked to see Mr Najib and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein to get more definite answers to the whereabouts of the missing jetliner and their loved ones, earlier reports said. Mr Hishammuddin on Saturday pledged to improve communications between Malaysia Airlines and the families of those aboard MH370. About two-thirds of the 239 passengers on board MH370 were Chinese nationals.
