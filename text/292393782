Acting Australian Prime Minister Warren Truss holds a press conference at the RAAF Base Pearce after meeting with pilots, crew and maintenance personnel of the RAAF Orions currently searching for the missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 on Saturday.  High-tech satellites and sophisticated radar systems have been used, but the search now turns on the success of scouring the seas by eye, seeking anything that may have come from Flight MH370.  Australian authorities, who are coordinating the search for possible debris in a vast region 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth, said on Friday that teams were prioritising visual clues over radar after poor weather had hampered their operation.
