SIBU: Residents of Lorong Kiew Nang 11D are protesting the installation of a communications tower in their neighbourhood. The residents had embarked on a signature campaign and managed to get 93 families with more than 300 people to ink their displeasure. They handed the signatures to Dudong assemblyman Yap Hoi Liong yesterday for further action. The residents told reporters they had no knowledge that the communications tower was coming up in their vicinity, and were fearful of having such a tower over the heads. “We did not receive prior notice from the authority about this tower, of which construction began a couple of weeks ago. “We fear this communications tower will bring about radiation and health hazards, as well as cause physical and mental deformities in children. “Some would be-residents have returned their purchases to the housing developer when they came to know of the tower,” claimed a resident. They appealed to the authority concerned to build the tower somewhere else.
