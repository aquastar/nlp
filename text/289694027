ISLAMABAD/KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian officials have contacted 25 countries, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and France, asking them to provide assistance in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.  The Malaysian officials said on Sunday that they have requested the countries to look into their radar facilities, satellite data, ground-search capabilities, and maritime and air assets to ascertain the whereabouts of the missing jetliner.  Giving her comments over the Malaysian request, Foreign Office spokesperson Tasneem Aslam said that there is no record or material on the Pakistani radars about the Malaysian airliner.  She said Malaysia has requested several countries to share their radar information and pointed out that otherwise too all the countries share information on radar.  The spokesperson said that if any information was received by Pakistan about the aircraft it would certainly share it with the Malaysian government.  Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday that the missing airliner appears to have been deliberately steered off course after someone on board shut down its communications.  A week after the disappearance of flight MH370, Najib said its last transmission of satellite data came nearly seven hours after it disappeared from radar screens.  But the new satellite data gave no precise location.
