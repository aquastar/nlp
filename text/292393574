PETALING JAYA: Gao Hua Yuan, the Chinese national who was kidnapped along with a Filipina on Wednesday, was planning to celebrate her birthday while on vacation in Sabah. She will be 30 years old this Tuesday, according to an entry in her Sina Weibo microblog. A graduate of Shanghai University of Science and Technology, Gao loves to travel and has been to Tibet, Taiwan, Myanmar and the Philippines. Her parents told Chinese media that she had planned to be in Sabah until April 10 and was travelling with a friend. She arrived in Malaysia on April 1, having insisted on visiting the country even after the disappearance of MAS Flight MH370, which was carrying mostly Chinese passengers to Beijing. "She thought the security in Sabah was still okay," her father told Shanghai People Radio. About 30 minutes before she was seized by armed men from the Singamata Reef Resort, she sent a text message to her mother to say she had just had a bath, he added. According to media reports, a group of unidentified armed men barged into the hotel at about 10. 30pm, seized Gao and 40-year-old resort worker Marcelita M Dayawan and sped off with them in a boat. Gao's parents learned of the kidnap some time later, when they read a message her travel companion had posted on We Chat. "We were so worried, we couldn't sleep all night," said the father. "We want to know what happened to the hostages and what the abductors want. "Malaysian authorities believe the abduction was committed by Abu Sayyaf, a small militia group based in the Southern Philippines. They suspect the captives are held in the remote island of Tawi Tawi.
