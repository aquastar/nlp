NIBONG TEBAL, March 30 — A mysterious package which was received by an officer yesterday at the Seberang Perai Prison in Sungai Jawi, here was found to contain two live bullets. During the 11. 30am incident, a 31-year-old woman prison officer opened the package and found the bullets which were wrapped in tissue paper. A police spokesman said the package was sent to the prison in February and the sender wrote the name of prison officer ‘ASP Nordin’ as the recipient.   “However, no such person by that name worked at the prison and the administration refused to accept the package.  It was returned to the post office. “But, after almost a month, the package was resent to the prison using the name of a sender and the same recipient, as previously,” he said here, today. The spokesman said the prison officer on duty, was suspicious of the delivery and decided to open the package and was shocked to find two live 9mm Luger S&W bullets. “Subsequently, the officer lodged a police report.  Preliminary investigation found the name and telephone number belonged to a woman in Sungai Petani, Kedah.   “However, the woman denied sending the package.  A check on records showed a prison officer by the name of ASP Nordin did undergo training at the prison two years ago,” he said. The spokesman said the officer was now working at the Alor Setar Prison but could not be contacted as he was on leave. Meanwhile, Seberang Perai Selatan District police chief Supt Shafien Mamat, said police were investigating the case.  — Bernama
