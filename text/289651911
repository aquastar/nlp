Bharathidasan Institute of Management (BIM) on Saturday entered into separate agreements with Hitachi Solutions India and Tentacle Technologies, Malaysia, for cooperation in research and academic programmes. The management institute signed the two memorandums of understanding with the companies during the on-going CRESCITA, a flagship management event of BIM. The pact with Hitachi Solutions India provides for in-campus partnership initiatives, including curriculum and faculty development programmes. Students of BIM would also get opportunities for internship under the agreement.  Hitachi India would arrange to deliver core curriculum modules through its own trainers and arrange to train designated faculty members to carry out the content delivery. The agreement with Tentacle Technologies seeks to enhance the quality of education for BIM students.  The MoU, valid for three years and renewable on mutual consent, will provide opportunities to BIM students to take up short-term research projects. Tentacle Technologies would provide appropriate input and direction that would form the basis for the industry-institute collaborative programme.
