BEIJING/SINGAPORE: Shot down by a military jet.  Blown up by terrorists.  Hijacked by elves. Ranging from the barely believable to the wildly absurd, popular theories about the fate of a missing Malaysian airliner circulate widely even as anguished relatives wait for news of its 239 passengers and crew. While they still cannot rule out a hijacking or bomb, officials seem increasingly sceptical that foul play caused its disappearance. Such doubts have done little to halt conspiracy theories spreading through the media and Internet, especially in the countries from which most passengers hailed: China and Malaysia.  Users of China’s popular Twitter-like microblogging service Sina Weibo have discussed theories ranging from an attack by Uighur militants from the country’s far western region of Xinjiang to stock market manipulation. “Maybe it was hit by a meteor?” wrote a user called laxnic.  “It would have been a more powerful impact than a missile and would have split the plane into tiny pieces.  It would all have been over so fast. ”“The plane did not crash – at least we’ve not seen any pictures to suggest this, and no wreckage has been found.  It’s being held prisoner in some country for political reasons,” suggested BoZíZiE on Sina Weibo. For some, the speculation feeds an obsession or provides macabre diversion.  —  Reuters
