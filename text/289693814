SEPANG, Malaysia - Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar has denied claims that Malaysia has rejected Interpol and FBI's assistance in relation to the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370's disappearance. "That's not true," he said.  "We work with every agency, including Interpol.  Anyone can say anything," he said at a press conference at Sama Sama Hotel here yesterday. Khalid also brushed off speculation by a US investigation team that claimed that MH370 was headed to India on a terrorist attack, similar to the Sept 11 incident. In the Sept 11, 2001, incident, a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks were launched by al-Qaeda against the United States in New York City and the Washington, DC metropolitan areas.  Four passenger airliners were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists so that these could be flown into buildings in suicide attacks.  Nearly 3,000 people were killed. Khalid also confirmed that police had searched the homes of the two pilots and were examining Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah's flight simulator. In Kajang, Home Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi concurred with Khalid over the offer of assistance from Interpol. "I think the collaboration between the country, via the police with Interpol, had long existed and we share a strong relationship with them.  Such issue should not arise," he added. Asked to comment on the reports that Zaharie was a lifetime PKR member and an ardent supporter of Opposition leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Dr Ahmad Zahid said all parties should set aside their political beliefs for now. "The mission currently is to find the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370," he said.
