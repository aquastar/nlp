The head of Emirates Airline on Tuesday defended the safety of the Boeing Co.  777 jet and expressed optimism that the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines aircraft over the weekend would be solved. Tim Clark, Emirates president, said the industry remained mystified why the jet had disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, given it should have been communicating with ground staff for the entire flight. Emirates is the largest operator of 777s, which Mr.  Clark called one of the most reliable jets in the skies. “For it to disappear without trace is an absolute mystery,” he said in an interview in Boston, having arrived the previous day from Dubai on the same 777-200LR model operated by Malaysia Airlines. Mr.  Clark said at any one time, a control room in Dubai monitors every movement for every single aircraft in its fleet of more than 200 jets.  The control center knows the names of the passengers and pilots on every aircraft and keeps an eye on each jet’s speed and propulsion systems, he said. The Malaysian jet lost contact during the cruise portion of the flight, which is normally described as the safest part of the trip.  “[The] level of interaction between aircraft and ground is second to none,” Mr.  Clark said.  “[The industry] will get to the bottom of this,” he added. He did caution that any catastrophic event on a jet – where it breaks up quickly after an explosion or structural failure – posed an obvious problem for airlines, even if they have the most sophisticated real-time communications. “If that happens, we are as lost as we are with this particular aircraft,” he said.
