KUALA LUMPUR: Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein gave his commitment that the search and rescue (SAR) operations for the missing MH370 will continue not only by the Malaysian government but also from all 26 countries involved.   “I gave them the assurance not only on behalf of the Malaysia government but so many nations involved in the operations.   “They felt relieved on the issue,” said Hishammuddin after meeting with the family members of passengers and crew on-board MH370 at the Everly Hotel, Putrajaya on Saturday.   The families from Malaysia and China, have also requested for authorities to not give up hope and that the SAR will continue even in remote areas.   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak on Monday announced that flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean, far from any possible landing strips.   “No matter how remote, hope against hope, we will continue to find for survivors,” Hishammuddin added.   Family members had also wanted assurance that the lines of communication between Malaysia Airlines and them are smoother and more sensitive to what they are going through.   On possible new leads of recovering MH370, Hishammuddin said there have been six sightings from satellite images so far and SAR vessels are moving towards the identified locations.   “I believe that there have been visuals sightings of the objects today.  I’ve got to wait to get reports on whether they have retrieved those objects and where they are going to bring the objects.  Those leads will give some indications.   “More than that, as I’ve told the families, I cannot give false hopes.  As long as there is a chance, even remote, of finding survivors - we will pray and do whatever it is. ” said Hishammudin.
