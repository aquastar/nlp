The Malaysian military has reportedly tracked the missing jetliner by radar over the Malacca Strait. The location is quite far from where the passenger plane last made radio contact with air traffic controllers off the country's east coast. The Boeing triple-7 apparently vanished one hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on Saturday. Since then, there has been no confirmed trace of the aircraft or the 2-hundred-thirty-nine people on board. A military official close to the investigation told Reuters that the plane had suddenly changed course, taking a lower altitude, and then made its way to the Malacca Strait. The disappearance is being considered one of the most unprecedented cases in recent aviation history. Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 had made no distress signal or indicated that there was any problem, leaving investigators to search through the passenger list and crew manifest for clues. Interpol's Secretary General Ronald Noble said Tuesday that the two passengers who used stolen Austrian and Italian passports to the board the missing plane had been identified. Noble said the two young men entered Malaysia using valid Iranian passports. He said 18-year old Pouria Nour Mohammadi and 29-year old Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza were likely trying to migrate to Germany. Interpol said it was unlikely that they were part of a terrorist group. Malaysian police earlier said they had not ruled out the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, or mechanical failure.
