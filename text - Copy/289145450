Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Of course, I don't know where Flight 370 is, nor do I know if terrorism is involved. But, hello - what's up with Malaysia Airlines?What happened at the airport before the plane pulled away from the jet way is just awful. Two passengers, each buying a ticket, one way, cash, 20 minutes before departure. Could anything look more suspicious? Would you not think, at a minimum, Malaysia Airlines would be a tad bit suspicious?Well, it gets even worse. Those same two one-way cash travelers are traveling on stolen passports. And that's not even hard to find out. All Malaysia Airlines had to do was run the passports through the Interpol database. Too lazy? Didn't care?And if that isn't bad enough? How about this? The United States government allows Malaysia Airlines, with their sloppy security, to it fly into the United States. They land in Los Angeles.What's wrong with this picture? A lot. Even if this mysterious disappearance turns out to be a mechanical error, what happened to all those promised security protocol for us passengers? Are we hoodwinked again? Both Malaysia Airlines and our own government have some explaining to do. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
