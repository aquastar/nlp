The teen had boarded the missing Malaysia Airlines flight to Beijing on Saturday using a stolen passport obtained in Thailand. Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said today the youth was believed to be planning to enter Germany to seek asylum.  “We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group,'' Khalid said. He added that the young man's mother was waiting for him in Frankfurt and had been in contact with the police.  He said she contacted Malaysian authorities to inform them of her concern when her son did not get in touch with her.
