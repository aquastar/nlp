North Korea fired 10 short-range missiles into the sea off the east of the Korean peninsula on Sunday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported, citing unidentified government officials in South Korea.Yonhap said the missiles flew for 70 kilometers (45 miles) before splashing into the sea.North Korea is not banned from short-range missile launches under UN sanctions and frequently tests its arsenal.The North has toned down its bellicose rhetoric towards the South, although it has denounced joint US-South Korean military exercises that are currently taking place.It undertook a series of short-range missile launches earlier this month as the joint exercises, which North Korea views as a threat to its security, started.In early 2013, North Korea conducted its third nuclear weapons test, having successfully launched a long-range rocket in 2012 that critics say was aimed at proving technology for an intercontinental ballistic missile.Both of these are banned under UN sanctions.Asked if Zaharie's background as an opposition supporter was being examined, the first senior police officer would say only: “We need to cover all our bases.”Malaysia Airlines has said it did not believe Zaharie would have sabotaged the plane, and colleagues were incredulous.“Please, let them find the aircraft first. Zaharie is not suicidal, not a political fanatic as some foreign media are saying,” a Malaysia Airlines pilot who is close to Zaharie told Reuters. “Is it wrong for anyone to have an opinion about politics?”Co-pilot Fariq was religious and serious about his career, family and friends said.The two pilots had not made any request to fly together.With no clear motive established as to why someone diverted the plane, Khalid said all possibilities -- hijack, sabotage, or personal or psychological problems of someone on board - were being investigated.Transport Minister Hishammuddin said authorities had not received any ransom or other demand. “That makes it very difficult for us to verify whether it's a hijacking or terrorist,” he said.Southeast Asia's homegrown Islamist militant groups, such as Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which carried out the Bali bombings in 2002, have been quiet in recent years after security forces either arrested or shot dead numerous members.Experts said they doubted the remaining militants had the skills or capabilities to carry out a complex hijacking.“JI has not been involved with violence in the region since 2007,” said Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.“The other groups that are active in Indonesia, in trying to make terrorist plots, are all not very competent. I would be extremely surprised if any group from Indonesia, the Philippines or Malaysia itself would be directly involved.”Analysis of satellite data showed the last signal from the missing plane was at 8:11 a.m., almost seven hours after it turned back over the Gulf of Thailand and re-crossed the Malay Peninsula.It's location was not pinpointed - experts could only determine that the plane could have been anywhere in either of two arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern arc heading from Indonesia to the vast southern Indian Ocean.Hishammuddin said Malaysia had requested further satellite data from several countries, including the United States, China and France, to help with the search.A source familiar with official US assessments said it was thought most likely the plane had headed south into the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed. Air space to the north is much busier, and the plane would likely have been detected.Countries contacted by Malaysia to assist in the search range from the former Soviet central Asian republics in the north to Australia in the south, along with France, which administers a scattering of islands deep in the southern Indian Ocean uninhabited except for a handful of researchers.The Indian Ocean is one of the most remote places in the world and also one of the deepest, posing enormous challenges for efforts to find any wreckage or the flight voice and data recorders that would be key to solving the puzzle.
