The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has rekindled a debate over the iconic ‘black box’ flight recorder and whether it’s time for aircraft to start live-streaming in-flight data in real time.Civil aviation industry sources agree the technology exists for commercial airliners to immediately relay via satellite vital technical information otherwise compiled by a flight data recorder in the course of a flight.But it’s another question whether airlines, forever struggling to keep costs down in a highly competitive business, want to front up the money involved, or even if it’s truly worth the expense.‘There are no technical barriers, and the cost barriers can be addressed,’ said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the US government agency that investigates major aviation accidents.‘But the reality is that air carriers don’t want to do anything unless they’re ordered to do it,’ he told AFP.Commercial airliners typically carry two black boxes, which in fact are bright orange. One monitors cockpit conversations, the other records a vast array of technical data from airspeed to engine performance.Whenever a crash occurs, investigators scramble to recover both devices, and if the tragedy happens on terra firma, they typically find them in short order.At sea, however, it’s another story.By then investigators already had a vague clue what might have happened thanks to the doomed flight’s Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), a digital datalink for brief text messages.It puts out limited information about location and airspeed, but nothing compared to the several thousand parameters that a black box can monitor during the course of a flight.Malaysia Airlines has said all its aircraft are ACARS-equipped, but it has so far declined to release whatever data it got from Flight 370.Twelve years ago, US avionics manufacturer L-3 estimated it would cost $US300 million ($A333.63 million) a year for a global airline to transmit flight data in real time, Bloomberg Businessweek magazine reported.The main hurdle is getting airlines to invest in such systems. Goelz said the onus is on governments to make them mandatory, as in the case of mid-air collision avoidance systems and smoke detectors in cargo holds.In an age when people assume that any bit of information is just a click away, the thought that a jetliner could simply disappear over the ocean for more than two days is staggering.But Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is hardly the first reminder of how big the seas are, and of how agonising it can be to try to find something lost in them.It took two years to find the main wreckage of an Air France jet that plunged into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.Closer to the area between Malaysia and Vietnam, where Saturday’s flight vanished, it took a week for debris from an Indonesian jet to be spotted in 2007. Today, the mostly intact fuselage still sits on the bottom of the ocean.‘If it happens to come down in the middle of the ocean and it’s not near a shipping lane or something, who knows how long it could take them to find?’ said Michael Smart, professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Queensland.Amid the confusion, officials involved in the search say the Malaysian jet may have made a U-turn, adding one more level of uncertainty to the effort to find it. They even suggest that the plane could be hundreds of kilometres from where it was last detected.Aviation experts say the plane will be found, eventually. Since the start of the jet age in 1958, only a handful of jets have gone missing and not been found.‘I’m absolutely confident that we will find this airplane,’ Captain John M Cox, who spent 25 years flying for US Airways and is now CEO of Safety Operating Systems, said on Monday.The modern pace of communications, where GPS features in our cars and smartphones tell us our location at any given moment, has set unreal expectations.‘This is not the first time we have had to wait a few days to find the wreckage,’ he said.Based on what he’s heard, Cox believes it’s increasingly clear that the plane somehow veered from its normal flight path.He said that after the plane disappeared from radar, it must have been ‘intact and flew for some period of time. Beyond that, it’s all speculation.’ If it had exploded midair along its normal flight path, ‘we would have found it by now.’Malaysian civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, whose agency is leading a multinational effort to find the Boeing 777, said more than 1,000 people and at least 34 planes and 40 ships were searching a radius of 100 nautical miles (185km) around the last known location of Flight MH370.No signal has been detected since early Saturday morning, when the plane was at its cruising altitude and showed no sign of trouble.Azharuddin said the search includes northern parts of the Malacca Strait, on the opposite side of the Peninsular Malaysia and far west of the plane’s last known location.Azharuddin would not explain why crews were searching there, saying, ‘There are some things that I can tell you and some things that I can’t.’Malaysian Major General Datuk Affendi Buang, who is helping oversee the ongoing search, said the search will take time.‘The only thing I could say is it’s difficult. There are so many examples of aircraft lost in the sea – you know it can take days, sometimes months, sometimes years,’ he said.Whether the plane broke up in midair or crashed into the water, there would be some debris.If the plane broke up ‘for some aerodynamic reason, like the wing fell off or there was a depressurisation, there’d be big chunks of wing and fuselage all over the place.So it’d be very unlikely that it would just be destroyed and turned to dust,’ said Smart, the aerospace engineering professor.He added that much of the wreckage may be at the bottom of the sea, which is 50 to 60 metres deep in the area where the plane was last detected.The size of the debris field will be one of the first indicators of what happened, aviation experts say.A large, widespread field would signal the plane likely broke apart at a high elevation, perhaps because of a bomb or a massive airframe failure.A smaller field would indicate the plane probably fell intact, breaking up upon impact with the water.
