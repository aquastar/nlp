PERTH: Australia has proved itself as ‘a friend in need is a friend indeed’ to Malaysia for its spontaneous action to search for the missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) MH370 flight without any timeline.Australia’s noble demeanour has prompted Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak to thank the country as an ‘invaluable friend’ to Malaysia.Najib during his two-day visit to Australia  last Thursday expressed his deep gratitude to his counterpart, Tony Abbott and 25 other countries that accepted Malaysia’s request to assist in the search for the aircraft.“We are also grateful to all those who have brought their expertise to bear on what Prime Minister Abbott rightly called ‘one of the great mysteries of our time’,” he told a joint press conference with Abbott.In fact Australian’s sincerity had shone further when Abbot had previously agreed to participate in the investigation of the MH370 as Accredited Representative.Australian Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) (retired) Air Chief Marshal, Angus Houston said the country was drafting a comprehensive agreement for that purpose in accordance with international law.“Other than Australia, United Kingdom, The United States and China are also members of the Accredited Representative on the investigation,” Houston told a press conference last Friday.During the visit, Najib and Abbott also discussed   the need of underwater drone and other equipment for a new phase of the jetliner search.A day later, JACC announced the deep sea search had begun while maintaining aerial hunt.Houston said it was the first time that a sub-surface search had been conducted in the search, in an attempt to detect the signal from the black box of MH370.“Using the Towed Pinger Locator (TPL) from the United States Navy on Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield and a similar capability on HMS Echo, the two ships will search a single 240-kilometre track, converging on each other,” he said.Malaysia is always in gratitude to those involved in the search as Najib puts it: “We recognised the efforts of the hundreds of men and women involved in the search.”“I know it is a daunting task to go out there in very inclement weather and in very challenging circumstances. Malaysia is indeed grateful for your courage and for your commitment,” said Najib when visiting the Royal Australian Air Force Pearce base with Abbott recently. — Bernama
