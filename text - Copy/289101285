KUCHING: Local oil and gas services player Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd (Dayang) is said to be at an inflection point which will herald a new era of strong growth trajectory for the group.As the biggest winner of RM10 billion Pan Malaysia hook-up commissioning (HUC) contracts awarded mid 2013, Dayang is now the ‘undisputed leader’ in HUC and topside major maintenance services, thanks to its excellent track record, says analysts at HwangDBS Vickers Research Sdn Bhd (HwangDBS Vickers Research).“While timely project execution for its strong orderbook in excess of RM4 billion will be the focus, Dayang is looking to participate in more offshore contracts including enhanced oil recovery projects by expanding its engineering and design expertise which will be complimentary to its existing operations,” it added.Malaysia’s robust contract flows since 2013 is a strong testament to the upcycle in the O&G industry. The research firm said like other O&G service providers, Dayang is now enjoying record high orderbooks, which imply good earnings visibility.“Since securing the mega contracts in mid-2013, Dayang has been working tirelessly in preparation for the execution of the work orders,” the research firm said, adding that the group has undertaken aggressive hiring activities to increase its manpower.Dayang’s capital expenditure of about RM150 million in financial year 2013 (FY13) WAS also the highest ever recorded since its inception, compared WITH RM40 million in FY12.We understand that DEHB has been busy looking at ways to further improve the operational efficiency. The management has tried to procure the full set of HUC/TMM equipment in order to save on the rentals which will help to increase the margins. While margin compression is inevitable in view of the rising cost, DEHB is likely to maintain good profitability vis-à-vis its peers, largely attributable to its lean operation.Additionally, Dayang’s 25 per cent-stake in Perdana Petroleum Bhd is poised to accelerate its growth momentum given the expected high utilisation of Perdana Petroleum’s 18 vessels in FY14 and the tightening supply of accommodation vessels.“Given that circa 85 per cent of its fleet is under long-term charters, Perdana Petroleum is still on the lookout for more work barges to cater to the rising demand,” HwangDBS Vickers added. “ We estimate the group will contribute 12 per cent and 14 per cent of Dayang’s FY14 and FY15 earnings, respectively.”Thus, HwangDBS maintained a target price of RM4.55 per share for Dayang based on an 18 times FY15 earnings per share.“We continue to like Dayang for its clear earnings visibility, solid balance sheet (at four per cent net gearing), and good execution track record.”
