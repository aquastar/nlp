Investigating authorities said Tuesday that two Iranians known to have used stolen passports to board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared Saturday do not appear to have been linked to terrorist groups.The discovery that two Iranians had boarded the ill-fated flight with stolen passports had raised fears about terrorist involvement in the disappearance of the flight.Malaysian authorities released photographs of the men boarding the flight together.The Associated Press reports that the Malaysian inspector general of police, Khalid Abu Bakar, said investigators have determined that one of the men was 19-year-old Pouiria Nur Mohammad Mehrdad who was planning to migrate to Germany.He used the passport of Austrian Christian Kozel, 30, stolen in Thailand about two years ago.The Malaysian police chief told reporters at a news conference, "We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group."He added: "We are in contact with his mother."The assessment by the Malaysian authorities that Mehrdad had no terror links and was only traveling to Germany to meet his mother was corroborated by Interpol.According to the New York Times, Interpol's secretary general, Ronald K. Noble, said at the agency's headquarters in Lyon, France, that the evidence suggests the two Iranians were only asylum seekers and likely had no links to terror groups."The more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident," he said.Reza used the passport of Italian Luigi Maraldi, reportedly stolen over a year ago.The two men arrived in Malaysia together Feb. 28, according to the Malaysian authorities. They used their Iranian passports to travel from Iran to Malaysia before switching to their fake European passports.According to the BBC, they stayed with a friend in Kuala Lumpur on arrival from Iran.The friend said the men were not terrorists and that he knew one of them from school. He said they purchased fake passports in Malaysia only because they wanted to go to Europe.They purchased their tickets through a travel agency in Pattaya, Thailand, called Grand Horizon Travel, owned by Benjaporn Krutnait, according to the Los Angeles Times.Thousands of Iranians reportedly leave the country every year for Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, from where they travel to Europe or Australia with the help of local travel agents and other human-traffickers.Following what appears confirmation that the two men with stolen passports were not terrorists, investigators were less convinced that the disappearance of the plane was due to a terrorist attack.Reports that two Iranians had boarded the plane using fake passports had raised concern among Iranian authorities, with some lawmakers accusing the West of engaging in "psychological warfare" against Iran.Hossein Naghavi, spokesman for the Iranian parliament's foreign policy committee, said: "Americans recruit some people for such kinds of operations so they can throw the blame on other countries, especially Muslim countries."
