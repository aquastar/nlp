The speculation was made former US deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott.PETALING JAYA: Was Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 hijacked to enable a Sept 11 type of terrorist attack on an Indian city?This was a theory postulated by former US deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott in his Twitter on Saturday.“Malaysian plane mystery: Direction, fuel load & range now lead some to suspect hijackers planned a 9/11-type attack on an Indian city,” he tweeted.He then tweeted a second theory to say that the hijackers were headed towards India but crashed just like the third plane involved in the Sept 11 attacks on the US.“Malaysian#370 as hijack: 1 of many theories. Speculation: hijackers headed toward India but crashed like UA#93 on 9/11,” he tweeted.Talbott, a foreign policy analyst is currently chairman of Brooklyn Institution.Yesterday Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak in his first press conference on the missing MH370 said the jetliner’s main communications and transponder had been deliberately shut off.He said that the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was disabled just before the aircraft reached the east coast of peninsular Malaysia.He added that the Beijing bound flight made a U-turn and headed towards the Andaman Sea.In a related development, India suspended its search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370 around the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands and in the Bay of Bengal and is awaiting a new request from Malaysia.“The entire operation is on hold for now. We are awaiting fresh instructions from Malaysia,” said Colonel Harmit Singh, spokesman for India’s army, navy and airforce command in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.“None of the planes from our air fleet took off today. Even the navy vessels involved in search operations have moved to another island,” Singh told AFP.Yesterday, national news agency Bernama reported that the Indian navy was expanding its search until the coast of Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu.The ill-fated flight carrying 239 passengers and crew lost contact with main air traffic control at 1.30am on March 8.
