Gerakan says the community should respond to the current recruitment drive.GEORGE TOWN: Gerakan has urged Chinese Malaysians to increase their presence in the police force by seizing the opportunity offered by the current recruitment drive.“We hope more Chinese men and women would come forward to take up the challenge to become policemen and serve the nation and the people,” said Penang Gerakan secretary Oh Tong Keong in a press statement released today.The Royal Malaysian Police last week began a two-month recruitment campaign that targets candidates from the Chinese community who are between 18 and 28 years old.Oh said the Chinese should discard their perception that the force would treat them unfairly because of their ethnic background or that the job would expose them to life-threatening risks.He said many Chinese policemen had risen to senior positions.Oh noted that the Home Ministry had relaxed some requirements so that more Chinese would be eligible for recruitment in the current drive.“Owing to increasing population and a greater need to enhance security and safety in our society, we certainly need to have more policemen and policewomen,” he said.He also said wages and other benefits had increased significantly over the years.Chinese Malaysians now account for 1,974 of the 111,395 police personnel in the country.“Currently, there are Chinese Malaysians being involved in voluntary policing,” he said. “However, they do not have much authority and their duties are limited.”
