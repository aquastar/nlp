Jakarta. Minister of Foreign Affairs Marty Natalegawa on Monday requested that Indonesian authorities in Malaysia provide support to the families of Indonesians who were on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of Saturday with 239 people on board.“I have asked our representatives in Kuala Lumpur to provide support for the families and to ensure that they will get what they need,” Marty said.He said the Indonesian government had deployed a marine unit and a plane to help Malaysia search for the missing plane.“The Malaysian authorities have also been informing us regularly about the status of the search,” he said.Marty said the Malaysian government was still collecting more information about the use of stolen passports on the flight.Indonesian Navy commander Adm. Marsetio told the state-run Antara news agency in Jakarta on Sunday that five warships and a helicopter were combing the Strait of Malacca for any possible wreckage of the plane following reports it may have turned back.Air safety specialists have been widely quoted in the media as saying the sudden loss of contact indicated something catastrophic happened to the aircraft, and the focus of the search on Sunday remained in the Gulf of Thailand around the plane’s last known location.The Boeing 777-200 aircraft vanished from radar screens on early Saturday morning, about an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing.Marty said families of five missing Indonesians on the flight had already flown to Malaysia.Meanwhile the family of Sugianto Lo and his wife Vinny Chyntya Tio, have also departed to Malaysia to seek more information about their missing family members.“The family of the couple left for Malaysia on Sunday,” Sugianto’s business partner, Jhony Taslim said.Jhony said Sugianto’s family had flown to Malaysia assisted by some of Malaysian airlines staff.“We are waiting for the latest news from the family. I hope they still can be found,” Jhony said, adding that Sugianto and his wife Vinny were en route to Beijing for a vacation.It was initially reported there were 12 Indonesians on the flight. The Foreign Affairs Minister later corrected the information and said there were only seven.The passenger manifest lists the Indonesian travelers as Firman Siregar, 25; Ferryindra Suadaya, 42; Herryindra Suadaya, 35; Lo Sugianto, 42; Indrasuria Tanurisam, 57; Vinny Chynthyatio, 47 and Willy Surijanto Wang, 53.While the airline continues to try and communicate with the families of those on board, the Malaysian navy said it was investigating whether the plane may have attempted to turn back immediately before contact was lost.Malaysian authorities said they were in possession of CCTV footage of two men confirmed to have checked in together and traveled on stolen passports but they had yet to be identified.UK newspaper the Daily Telegraph said it had confirmed that the men using the stolen passports had tickets, which had been purchased from a travel agent in Pattaya, Thailand, through a middle man. They had connecting flights from Beijing to Europe.Samples taken from an oil slick off the north east coast of Malaysia have been found to be unconnected to the missing flight. JG
