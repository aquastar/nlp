BANGKOK: Thailand's senate election went on smoothly yesterday although it faced a low voter turnout and a few election-related incidents, including a bomb explosion in the south that killed two policemen who were guarding a polling station."I think the elections is not a difficult matter if the political situation is stable," said Election Commission member, Somchai Srisitthiyakorn, at a press conference here after polling closed in the afternoon.Therefore, he called for the involved parties in the current political crisis to end the conflict so that the country would be able to conduct an election as smooth as yesterday.Somchai said senate election today was smooth and totally different from the earlier disruptions faced by the now annulled general election, and the election staff were able to discharge their duties without interruption.On the incidents, he said two policemen were killed and five people injured by a bomb attack at a polling centre in Ruesoh district in Narathiwat Province in the south.The election today was to choose 443 candidates for 77 senate seats to represent the 77 provinces in the country. The senate has 150 members and the rest are appointed.There are 48.8 million voters, including 4.1 million in Bangkok and overall only less than half of the voters turned up to vote yesterday.Bernama visited dozens of polling stations in the morning and by midday most of them only reported less than 30% of voter turnout.Thailand also invited observers from other countries, including from Malaysia.Unlike in the past, many of the anti-government protesters also exercised their duties to vote yesterday. Many said they did not exercise their voting rights during the previous controversial general election on Feb 2, because the country needed a reform first before election for the lower house was held. â€“ Bernama
