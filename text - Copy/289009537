When an Air France jetliner disappeared from radar and plunged into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, a daunting search-and-rescue operation ensued.Bodies and debris from the Rio de Janeiro-to-Paris flight emerged in the days and weeks following the crash, but investigators took nearly two years to retrieve the main wreckage and "black boxes" from Flight 447.As a massive multinational effort to find the missing Malaysia Airlines jet coalesces over the next few days, aircraft experts warn that the search will be a costly and complicated one. Indeed, it wouldn't be uncommon for several days to pass before searchers found any wreckage of the aircraft floating on the ocean.If a plane goes down in very deep water - as the Air France flight did - the search is that much more difficult."The deeper you get, the harder it is to see," says Jim Hall, president of consulting firm Hall & Associates and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.Search-and-recovery workers have to deal with basic challenges such as locating the downed craft and more complex issues such as navigating the ocean terrain below the surface."It's very expensive and very technical work," says Hall. "Trying to get the proper people assembled usually takes quite a bit of time."Malaysia Airlines said sea and air searches are ongoing for the plane, which was carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it disappeared early Saturday local time. More than 24 hours after last contact with the plane, there was still no sign of wreckage, the airline said. No emergency signals or distress messages were received before the plane vanished from radar.The Vietnamese government reported Saturday that oil slicks - thought to be from the missing aircraft - were spotted between Malaysia and Vietnam. The airline did not provide any information on that report.Adding to the search difficulties, the plane could be located across a wide swath of land or water, in many pieces large and small."You can't be sure that all the wreckage will be in one location," said Hall, who oversaw past ocean recoveries during his NTSB tenure. "There's a possibility that the wreckage could be scattered."As of Saturday ET, search-and-rescue teams from China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam were among the groups seeking the missing twin-engine jet. The USS Pinckney, a destroyer in the Navy's 7th Fleet, was headed to the southern coast of Vietnam to aid in the search efforts.Such search-and-recovery missions are incredibly expensive undertakings, costing millions and even billions of dollars, says John Cox, a retired airline captain who runs the aviation safety consulting company Safety Operating Systems.A large percentage of the cost is paid by insurance, he says, but other parties - such as governments, plane manufacturers and airlines - could also foot part of the bill.Regarding the Malaysia Airline flight, "They know the track that the airline was on and had been flying, so they had a baseline from which to start" the search, says Cox.The initial search will focus on the surface of the ocean, he says. And then it will move to underwater sonar and other techniques.As for the cause of the crash, investigators "will look at human factors, technical factors, systematic and operational factors" to "evaluate what chain of events led to this tragedy."An aviation lawyer who worked on cases with problems similar to the Malaysia Airlines disaster says the lack of warnings about a problem aboard the Malaysia Airline flight suggest a catastrophic failure during flight.Steve Marks, who represented relatives of victims in the Air France crash, said the Malaysia Airlines plane should have relayed reports of any problems - if there were any Ã¢?? as the jet did in the Air France case. That Air France Airbus A-330 signaled flight errors to the manufacturer's headquarters in France.A lack of such reports is why Marks speculates that there was a catastrophic failure, perhaps the plane breaking up from a lack of pressurization or from a complete electrical failure."There would have been some type of reporting, whether through the radios or the computer system," Marks said. "The complete absence of any information suggests a catastrophic failure."Read the original story: As Air France crash showed, recovery can be long, daunting
