Three separate signals from what is thought to be the plane’s black box were picked up.An Australian vessel homed in on a bleep from a flight recorder in the massive search area of the southern Indian Ocean.A Chinese craft detect-ed two beacon “pings” in a different stretch of the sea.Search teams are now in a race against time to locate the Malaysia Airlines jet as experts fear electronic pulses will expire today as batteries run flat.The hoped-for breakthrough came as a top Malaysian government source revealed that the Boeing 777 deliberately flew around Indonesian airspace and dropped off military radar during its doomed flight.The shock revelation suggests the pilot may have intentionally taken a route to avoid detection, lending support to the theory that its disappearance was not a freak accident.
