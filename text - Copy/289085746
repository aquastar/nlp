KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Bernama) -- All opposition members of parliament (MPs) did not put on the official ceremonial white uniform today, which is the norm to wear during the opening of a Parliamentary sitting.On the other hand, they wore black suits, with some adding the songkok while the women elected representatives wore national costumes such as baju kurung.Not only did they not wear the official uniform, they also did not take part in the parade and royal banquet at the Official Opening Ceremony of the First Meeting, Second Session of the 13th Parliament by Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah here.Opposition Chief Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said their move was a sign of protest and opposition to the nation's laws "which were unjust".Nevertheless, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong has been informed of the absence of the MPs at the royal banquet."I have sent a letter to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to clarify our stand on the matter. We attend the opening ceremony to show our love and loyalty to His Majesty but we will not attend the feast and parade because we do not want to be in cahoots with a cruel and corrupted group," he said, when met after the opening.Anwar said all 89 of the opposition-elected representatives were adamant about not attending the Dewan Rakyat sitting tomorrow to protest against the Court of Appeal's five-year jail sentence on the opposition chief after finding him guilty of sodomy on Friday.On the other hand, they will attend the nomination for the by-election in Kajang tomorrow.Last Friday, the Court of Appeal imposed a five-year jail sentence on Anwar on a charge of sodomising his former aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, about six years ago.In a follow-up to the decision of the court, DAP national chairman Karpal Singh, who is also Anwar's counsel, said the opposition leader could not file his nomination paper for the by-election in Kajang.Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) president Datin Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail was announced as the candidate for the oposition pact for the by-election in Kajang.Meanwhile, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim, when met, said the boycott of the Dewan Rakyat sitting tomorrow by the oppositions would only be a loss to them because the people would not be able to know the questions raised by their elected representatives."We have provided answers to every question in the Dewan Rakyat. The people lose when they cannot hear the questions asked by the members of parliament concerned."Here (Dewan Rakyat) is a place where we debate and formulate laws. No need to go to Kajang to debate. We cannot debate the laws in Kajang. Kajang is the deciding place for the selection of an elected representative," he said.Dewan Negara president Tan Sri Abu Zahar Ujang said the proceedings of the Dewan Rakyat would not be affected by the absence of opposition MPs.
