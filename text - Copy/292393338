KUCHING: Deputy Home Minister Datuk Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar doubts whether Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) can be extended to Sarawak.The Santubong MP said this is because if Esscom is to be extended to the state, the area of coverage would be too large.“I’m not confident that Esscom can be extended until Sarawak. Our area is big. If the government wants to form security area in Sarawak, it must be put under Sarawak and under the chief minister of Sarawak,” he told a press conference after officiating the closing of ‘Fiesta Kolej Komuniti Santubong Bersama Komuniti 2014’ at Demak Laut here yesterday.Wan Junaidi was asked to comment on Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein’s statement that Esscom would be extended to Sarawak in the future.Hishammuddin also said at the same time, cooperation with the Philippines and Brunei governments would be enhanced to ensure the sovereignty and security of this region.Wan Junaidi said it would not be a problem for the plan to be implemented because security in Sarawak also had to be maintained.“That is why I also travel to Samalaju to evaluate the equipments and facilities owned by the police.“Last time we detected piracy in Bintulu. We need to ensure the security in Bintulu because the area has big asset worth RM150 million.”He said any plan to extend Esscom to Sarawak must be based on its practicality, considering that the state has a long border with neighbouring countries such as Indonesia and Brunei.On the kidnapping of foreign tourists in Sabah, he said Esscom would have to enhance the level of security in the area and identify any weaknesses.“If we look at the area under Esscom’s watch, it is very big and impossible for them to look after the whole area.”According to him, initial investigation showed that there was involvement of ‘insiders’ in the incident.“Therefore, the community has to be aware of their own security. And if possible, every staff in the island resorts should be screened and checked for their backgrounds and criminal records.”When told that resort operators in the area were unhappy with his suggestion that they cease operations, he clarified: “I was saying that if I can have it, personally I feel that is the best solution.“But I am also aware that these are tourism facilities and if you close it, the tourism industry will be affected.”“Therefore I call again on Esscom to buck up.“There must be something that can be done. Esscom must conduct study on the islands in their area and work together with the island resort operators in maintaining security.”
