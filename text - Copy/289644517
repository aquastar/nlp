Flight MH370 disappeared nine days ago and no trace has since been found [REUTERS]The theory comes after it was revealed the final “all right, good night” message from the plane’s cockpit came 14 minutes after the flight’s ACARS reporting system was disabled.Now Malaysian Authorities are seeking diplomatic permission to investigate the theory that the Boeing 777 and its 239 passengers have been flown to a Taliban controlled area of northwestern Pakistan and Afghanistan, The Independent reported.It is thought the plane may have dropped to an altitude of less than 5,000 ft to evade being detected by radar as it flew over other countries.An official confirmed the plane had flown at a low lever over Kelentan, Malaysia.Speaking to the New Strait Times he said: "The person who had control over the aircraft has a solid knowledge of avionics and navigation, and left a clean track. It passed low over Kelantan, that was true."It's possible that the aircraft had hugged the terrain in some areas, that are mountainous to avoid radar detection".It is also thought that the final message from the plane, "all right, good night", may have been made by the co-pilot rather than the pilot.Airline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said: "Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape."Experts have said only a trained person would have the skills necessary to turn of the plane’s tracking system.Following the developments, the backgrounds of the pilots are being investigated, as a search of one of their homes revealed a sophisticated flight simulator.Electronic signals between the plane and satellites continued to be exchanged for nearly six hours after MH370 flew out of range of Malaysian military radar off the northwest coast, following a commercial aviation route across the Andaman Sea towards India.However, Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan said the missing plane had nothing to do with them."It happened outside Afghanistan and you can see that even countries with very advanced equipment and facilities cannot figure out where it went, so we also do not have any information as it is an external issue."The news comes after police searched the home of pilot Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his number two, Fariq Abdul Hamid.
