A MALAYSIA Arlines Boeing 777 jumbo jet (Flight MH370) carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members vanished en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur since Saturday.A multinational search and rescue effort participated in by some 40 vessels and 34 aircraft found no trace of the missing plane.Authorities are chasing “every angle” of its mysterious disappearance. As of now, the jumbo jet and the 239 people on board are simply lost.Malaysian transport and aviation officials warned the media not to report unverified information about the missing plane.This incident reminds me of the American TV series “Lost” that follows the survivors of the crash of a commercial passenger jet flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, on a mysterious tropical island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean.But the “Lost” TV series was pure fiction. Flight MH370 is still lost.The head of Malaysia’s Civil Aviation Authority, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, called the disappearance of the Malaysian airlines “an unprecedented aviation mystery.”Samples of oil slick found in the South China seas were sent to a lab but later found not to have come from the plane.The Boeing 777 is one of the biggest commercial airliners in the world with a strong safety record. It’s too big to vanish without leaving a trail.The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) 7 is conducting a feasibility study on the construction of a Cebu Expressway from Danao City in the north to Carcar City in the south, away from urban centers.If this pushes through, this would be Cebu’s first expressway.The national highway in Cebu is being slowly widened from two lanes to four lanes, but only for the widened areas to be made parking areas for vehicles.
