Police have classified the case of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 as an act of terrorism, which also included hijacking and sabotage, said the Inspector-General of Police.Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters today all procedures under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 applied here.This, he said, would also provide investigation under the Aviation Offences Act.Khalid also said that police are still focusing on four areas of investigations which include hijacking, sabotage, personal and psychological problems."That doesn't change," he said.Malaysian authorities said yesterday that the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, carrying 239 passengers and crew, was deliberately diverted and had its onboard transmission devices switched off to avoid detection.Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said that investigations showed that the passenger jet's movements and shutdown of communication links were deliberate acts, but had stopped short of calling the entire scenario a hijack.The focus of the investigations is now on the 53-year-old pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah and co-pilot, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid.Police yesterday conducted a search Zaharie's home, where they seized a flight simulator. A similar search was also carried out in Fariq's home."In light of the new development, we went to his house and took possession of the flight simulator."We dismantled it from the home and we have assembled it at our office. We are getting experts to go through it," Khalid said.When asked why the search was not done earlier, Khalid said that authorities had not seen a necessity earlier.He also said that Malaysia had yet to receive reports on background checks on all passengers on board the missing flight MH370 from their respective countries."There are still a few countries yet to respond to our request for a background check. China and India have done it," he said.However, he added that a few intelligence agencies have cleared all passengers but declined to reveal further."We are investigating all passengers and crew. Only a few agencies have cleared them, not all," he said. – March 16, 2014.
