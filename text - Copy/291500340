Perth/Kuala Lumpur: Angry relatives of Chinese passengers aboard the Malaysian plane today demanded that Malaysia must apologise for hastily concluding that the jet had crashed in the Indian Ocean, as the hunt for debris failed to yield any leads despite sighting several objects.Possible debris sightings by Chinese, Australian and New Zealand military planes did not find any solid clues in one the most baffling aviation mysteries, compounding the frustration of families who have been waiting for more thanthree weeks to get detailed and confirmed information on the 239 missing passengers aboard Flight MH370.The search for the Malaysia Airlines jet entered the 22 day today with 10 aircraft and eight ships tasked to scour the Indian Ocean, after early sightings in the new search zone drew a blank.The chief of the China Maritime Search and Rescue Center, He Jianzhong said that the international effort had not found any objects linked to the plane today, and that Chinese vessels would expand their search area.Some 29 family members from China arrived in Kuala Lumpur and held a news conference at their hotel, imploring officials to be more transparent. About 50 more family members joined those who had earlier flown to Malaysia, saying they hoped to get more information from officials."We want evidence, we want truth and we want our family," said Jiang Hui, the families' designated representative. The crowd chanted the same words. "We will stay until the final end," he said, adding that they would express their requirements in an appropriate and legal way.They also asked Malaysia to apologise for releasing confusing information and for announcing on March 24 that the plane had crashed without "direct evidence". Jiang said the families also call for a meeting with aircraft manufacturers and service providers such as Boeing and Rolls-Royce.Meanwhile, approximately 252,000 square kilometres were searched by nine aircraft from countries like the US, Australia, China.Eight ships were tasked in the MH370 search area with a merchant ship also transiting through the area. Â "Aircraft in the search area have continued to report sightings of objects similar to those reported previously.Objects sighted by aircraft cannot be verified or discounted as being from MH370 until they are relocated and recovered by ships. Nothing has yet been verified as being from MH370," Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said.
