Lacking clear-cut answers about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, aviation industry leaders are looking for ways to prevent key safety and communications systems from being disabled by anyone on commercial airplanes in the future.Potential changes include making satellite-messaging systems and transponders that communicate with air-traffic-control radar virtually tamper-proof.For some models, the redesign might extend to further protecting the integrity of so-called “black box” recorders that capture flight data, pilots’ voices and other cockpit sounds.The primary goal is to make it practically impossible for flight crews or passengers to turn off electrical power to these devices in midair by removing circuit breakers now normally accessible in the cockpit.No consensus has emerged on the need for such complicated, costly changes, let alone who would pay for them. Officials at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board have declined to talk about issues related to their participation in the Malaysian investigation, including potential safety recommendations.Nevertheless, discussion of the possible changes reflects how the Boeing 777′s baffling disappearance and suspected crash—one of the most mysterious events of the modern jet age—have upset traditional principles of aircraft design and accident investigation.“We never used to discuss the possibility of someone deliberately turning off anything that was transmitting vital information from the plane,” said Ray Valeika, a former head of maintenance and engineering at Delta Air Lines Inc. “It was never a factor.”In the case of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, investigators are convinced that a person or individuals inside the jet deliberately turned off or disabled its basic satellite-communications system and transponder, while taking the widebody aircraft far off its planned course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.A motive for such actions remains the subject of intense scrutiny.Ensuring that rogue pilots or hijackers can’t turn off essential equipment generally hasn’t been a major consideration for plane makers, parts suppliers or regulators. But with the multinational probe and air-and-sea search for Flight 370 showing scant progress after more than a month, the issue is now being debated by safety experts and increasingly is at the center of industrywide deliberations.“The most important item is to make the relevant systems truly tamper-proof,” according to Harold Demuren, Nigeria’s former head of civil aviation. “We have all the technology necessary to accomplish that.”Meanwhile, many systems rely on readily accessible circuit breakers to allow pilots to quickly isolate or disable equipment in the event of in-flight smoke or fire.The satellite-messaging system that effectively stopped sending data from the 777, known as Acars, ordinarily transmits routine maintenance information and updates on the operating condition of the aircraft. It can be disabled using a series of keystrokes on the flight-management computer. But to access circuit breakers for the plane’s recorders, someone has to enter an electronics bay located under the cabin floor.A newer generation of jetliners, including Chicago-based Boeing Co.’s 787, have solid-state circuit breakers, which are controlled by software.Still, a majority of the most popular jetliners in service, including current versions of single-aisle Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s, offer direct cockpit access to electrical circuit breakers for systems like the transponder, both recorders and Acars, which stands for Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System.Last week, the head of the airline industry’s biggest global trade association called for expanding Acars or related systems to assure universal, real-time satellite tracking of practically all airliners.Tony Tyler, chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, wants “urgent action and careful analysis” to produce world-wide standards intended to help transmit the position of commercial aircraft regardless of where they fly.As part of that initiative with major airlines and international safety groups, the trade association wants to study how to guarantee that tracking couldn’t be disabled under any circumstances, according to a person familiar with the details.For decades, safety advocates have promoted redundant systems, more reliable engines, enhanced pilot training and voluntary incident reporting to dramatically reduce accident rates. Today, flying on scheduled airliners is safer than ever throughout the world. IATA’s statistics for 2013 indicate that Western-built jets experienced one serious accident for 2.4 million flights world-wide, nearly 15% better than the five-year average.Questions about what transpired in the Malaysian jet’s cockpit, though, suddenly have prompted revisions to safety criteria. As an extra precaution in the future, “it would be nice to make certain systems entirely independent” of the plane’s electric grid, according to Robert Francis, a former vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.That philosophy has worked well historically for satellite operators requiring ultimate reliability, according to Roger Rusch,a California-based space consultant.Once a satellite is blasted into orbit, “there are a number of different ways to make certain we don’t lose track of it from the ground,” he said. Those assured links  some of which can’t be remotely turned off for any reason—mean that “critical information about altitude or control-system failures is always accessible,” according to Mr. RuschIn addition to aircraft rolling off assembly lines, contemplated changes also could affect the fleet of more than 20,000 commercial aircraft worldwide. Modifications would be “very time consuming, very expensive and a big regulatory process,” said Joe Clark, chief executive of Aviation Partners Inc., which designs modifications to existing aircraft.It would be “a big deal,” Mr. Clark added, “to change entire electrical systems.”Mr. Valeika agrees “it wouldn’t be simple at all” to accomplish, partly due to the need to evaluate unintended consequences and possible pilot confusion.
