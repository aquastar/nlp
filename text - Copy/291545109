No evidence terrorists are behind missing Malaysia jet - US intelligenceThere has been a great deal of speculation about the reasons for the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines flight just over three weeks ago, but there's no evidence of terrorism, said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein. "So far, there's been none," the California Democrat assumed.Feinstein noted the situation is "very hard" because searchers and officials "don't have what they need to carefully calculate a reasonable area where the plane may be. This is a very difficult mission".There are many nations participating in the search, Feinstein said, "but there is no real method of calculation that is functioning very well"."I'm not going to go in to what we do have or what we don't have," Feinstein said. "You have to understand that American intelligence doesn't gear itself to be ready for plane crashes".Meanwhile, Feinstein said that she is sure that, if asked, US intelligence services would provide whatever data they have. She stressed that Malaysia is in charge of the investigation, and the United States can offer its advice, "but you can't demand".As far as the "jet hunt" goes, Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he hopes some clue will soon be found that will help narrow the area of the search operation in the Indian Ocean, as more objects are being retrieved in the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that vanished off air control radar screens over three weeks ago.Even though more ships are scouring the area off Western Australia, none of the recovered items has been connected with the Malaysia Airlines plane that allegedly crashed on March 8 with 239 people on board.In Sydney, the Australian premier described the "intensifying search effort" as positive because objects had been recovered from the ocean.The Australian Maritimes Safety Authority said 10 planes took part in the search Sunday, leaving at staggered times from the western city of Perth. Eight ships were on the scene, including the Australian navy supply ship HMAS Success, which is to store any wreckage found.The ships are trying to locate and identify objects sighted by aircraft over the past two days. The operation was made more difficult because the particular area being combed is in a shipping lane littered with potentially more floating objects.Among the items spotted over the last day were three white, red and orange objscts seen by a Chinese search plane, according to a report from China's official Xinhua News Agency said. The missing Boeing 777's exterior was red, white, blue and gray.Newly analyzed satellite data shifted the search zone on Friday, raising expectations that searchers may be closer to finding physical evidence that the plane crashed into the Indian Ocean. The change came after analysts determined that the Boeing 777 may have been traveling faster than earlier estimates and would therefore have run out of fuel sooner.That would narrow the hunt for the wreckage and the plane's black boxes, which should contain clues to what caused the plane to be so far off-course.Even if investigators can determine that the plane went down in the newly identified search zone, recovery of its flight data and cockpit voice recorders will be complicated.The sea floor within the search area is covered in squishy sediment and generally flat, save for a steep slope and trench near its southern end.Unless the plane's fuselage went down the slope or into the trench, the underwater geography should not hinder the search.Data on the black boxes may help investigators to solve what has become one of aviation's big mysteries - what happened to Flight 370, with speculation ranging from equipment failure and a botched hijacking to terrorism or even a deliberate act by one of the pilots.Meanwhile, several dozen Chinese relatives of passengers on Flight 370 arrived in Kuala Lumpur Sunday to demand a meeting with top Malaysian officials for more information about what happened to the airliner. Two-thirds of the 227 passengers aboard the plane en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur were Chinese, and Beijing has urged Malaysia to be more open about the investigation.
