DAP Chairman Karpal Singh leaves the Jalan Duta courthouse in Kuala Lumpur after being found guilty of sedition today. – The Malaysian Insider pic, March 11, 2014. A defiant Karpal Singh stood by what he said in February 2009 that the Sultan of Perak was not above the law."I was doing my duty as an MP and lawyer and said that the ruler can be taken to court," he told reporters after the High Court in Kuala Lumpur fined him RM4,000 for sedition.The 73-year-old wheelchair-bound politician said the prosecution was entitled to press for a deterrent sentence."That is their right but Barisan Nasional must be prepared to answer the people in the court of public opinion," he said.He said there would not be an immediate by-election for his Bukit Gelugor seat as he would also be filing a notice of appeal against the sentence.On February 21, judge Datuk Paduka Azman Abdullah found him guilty but the sentence was deferred to today."I have two more rights of appeal in the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court," said the national DAP chairman who was also held under the now-repealed Internal Security Act in 1987.Karpal, who has been in politics since 1974, said opposition politicians risked prosecution when they spoke for the people."But if you are afraid, then you cannot represent the people. But the fight goes on," he said, adding that eliminating one Karpal would give birth to 100 more Karpals."Karpal said he would be in Kajang and would speak at a ceramah in support of PKR candidate Datuk Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail.After the verdict, Karpal was given a rousing send-off as DAP members and supporters waited with banners which read: "We support Karpal Singh."Others repeatedly chanted "Hidup, Hidup, Hidup Karpal" before he was whisked away in a four-wheel drive.Bar Council chairman Christopher Leong said he supported the position taken by Karpal's counsel that the accused be given a bound over for good behaviour as he was merely expressing his views on the law and the constitution."However, we were disappointed that the judge denied us the right to give our views as this case in widely followed in the Commonwealth as it involved as senior lawyer and lawmaker," he said.Leong said Karpal would be able to practice law even if he failed to overturn the conviction as this offence did not amount to a professional misconduct.Opposition leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim , who rushed from Kajang to follow the proceedings, said he was disgusted and disappointed with the manner in which Deputy Public Prosecutor Noorin Badaruddin conducted herself when making her submission ."She sounded like a Perkasa spokesperson," Anwar said in reacting to Noorin's suggestion that the court would be showing disrespect to the royal institution if Karpal got away with a light sentence.He said Noorin sounded vicious and angry and did not display court decorum."I understand if Umno lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah behaves like that because he works for the party, but not from a DPP," he said.However, Anwar commended the judge for his decision to expunge selected parts of Noorin's submission from the notes of proceedings.PAS deputy president Mohamed Sabu also strongly echoed the views of Anwar and went on say that Noorin was more of a Biro Tatanegara speaker to indoctrinate judges and lawyers."She was using the court as a forum to give her ceramah," he added.Mat Sabu said Karpal was the latest of many opposition leaders and those not aligned with Putrajaya who were selectively prosecuted for sedition."There were many others like (former prime minister) Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and Perkasa president (Datuk Ibrahim Ali) who have made worse inflamatory remarks, but were not charged," he said.DAP supremo Lim Kit Siang said he was shattered by the verdict against his long-time comrade in the party.He declined to comment as he had promised to refrain from making public statements until tomorrow.Party secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said he was saddened that Noorin had used his conviction, also for sedition in 1997, as a benchmark to obtain a severe punishment for Karpal."I too spoke for justice, but for an under aged girl and my civil and political liberties were taken away for 10 years," added Guan Eng, now Chief Minister of Penang.Guan Eng said it was now left to the people to bring about changes and restore their rights as provided under the law. – March 11, 2014.
