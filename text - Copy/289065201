MALACCA: The Malacca government has raised concern over the influx of foreigners in the state, as some have daringly utter slurs that could slight the feelings of the multi-ethnic local community.Chief Minister Datuk Seri Idris Haron said the foreigners comprise 10% of the state’s population of 850,000, not including those who were labelled as illegal immigrants.“There are 89,269 registered foreigners in Malacca, but I am not sure of the actual number of illegal immigrants ‘outside our radar’,” he said after the state assembly sitting recently.He said the huge number of foreigners could pose a risk to the state’s security aspects and deprive locals of business opportunities.“These foreigners would certainly be patriotic to their homelands and they could retaliate in unsavoury manner if touched certain sentiments.“This is a case of being loyal to their country and we don’t expect foreigners to pledge their allegiance to our nation,” he said.Idris said the presence of a high number of foreigners could also impact the social fabric of the local society.“We need to closely monitor the influx of foreigners to prevent any negative repercussions in future.“The state government has urged enforcement agencies to eradicate the rising number of foreigners in the state,” he said.Idris also called upon the Immigration Department to strengthen its enforcement at all entry points to curb the flow of illegal immigrants into the country.Meanwhile, Ayer Keroh state assemblyman Khoo Poay Tiong said the growing number of aliens in the state was also contributing greatly to crime rate.He also noted the mushrooming of hawker businesses by foreigners.“The lack of enforcement has made these aliens more daring to operate their businesses without fear.“Foreign nationals are not supposed to trade without permits, but in Malacca you can see them operating without the necessary permits,” he said.Khoo said some of these foreigners also made racial slurs against minorities in the state.“They come as foreign workers and stay in our communities, eventually taking advantage of locals and even to the extent of labelling some (Malaysians) as immigrants,” he added.
