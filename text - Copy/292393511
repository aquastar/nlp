A few days earlier, Hishammuddin spoke of Malaysia's duty to keep its giant neighbour informed about all progress.James Chin (pic, left), professor of political science at Monash University’s Kuala Lumpur campus, said the rift always appeared larger in the media than at an official level."I think among the diplomats they do understand this is just a small thing within the larger context of Malaysia-China relations and this will not alter relationships in the long term," he told CNN.At stake between the two countries is a thriving economic relationship, said CNN, which cited Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade putting China as Malaysia's largest trading partner for the fifth consecutive year in 2013. Trade between the two countries that year grew by 12.5% to US$63.4 billion (RM207.92 billion).Tourism numbers were equally positive, with some 1.8 million Chinese tourists last year – an increase of 14.9% from the previous year.Speaking to CNN, Tan Sri Ramon Navaratnam, former secretary-general of the ministry of transport, said he did not expect trade between the two countries to deteriorate despite the initial protests by some of the affected Chinese families in Beijing."I don't see it happening as the Chinese authorities, especially their envoy (Huang Huikang) to Malaysia, have given very measured statements and not blamed Malaysia for MH370," said Ramon, currently the chairman of the Center for Public Policy Studies at the Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute.Ramon (pic, right), who has authored several books on economics in Malaysia, said the business environment would not change unless the two governments decided otherwise.An economics lecturer at the University of Malaya, Lee Hwok Aun, meanwhile, agreed that bilateral trade was not expected to fall as Malaysia's primary exports to China consist of electrical components and raw materials, such as crude rubber and palm oil, critical to China's own economy."Tourism may suffer some minor setbacks initially but exports won't change much as China needs raw materials," Lee told CNN. "It's much harder to organise a boycott of component imports, and China too wants a steady supply chain." – April 7, 2014.
