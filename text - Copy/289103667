PETALING JAYA, Malaysia - Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak spent more than an hour discussing with top security officials on ways to move forward in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane.Among those present at the meeting were Air Force chief General Tan Sri Rodzali Daud, Armed Forces chief Jen Tan Sri Zulkifeli Mohd Zin and Civil Aviation Department director-general Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman.Najib was at the department's premises in Subang from 4.45pm to about 6pm yesterday.Azharuddin confirmed that they were discussing how to move forward in the operation as they had yet to get any new lead after scouring 100 nautical miles of the search area.On rumours on social media claiming that a stewardess on board the missing plane had managed to call her husband, Azharuddin said they would seek an explanation from the family member."We did not receive any such report. Once we have identified the person (the stewardess' husband), we will call him up to verify the report."
