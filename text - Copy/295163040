The field trips were part of a coming House push on education, a topic that’s been overshadowed lately amid battles about health care and budgets. Though the sniping about the health-care law is unlikely to go away anytime soon, both Democrats and Republicans see education legislation as a key plank in their midterm campaigns.The GOP-controlled House is pushing a bill aimed at expanding access to charter-school funding and making it easier to open new charter schools modeled after successful ones. Senate Democrats’ legislation—which they plan to roll out later this spring—takes a different tack, focusing on making college more affordable and easing the burden of student-loan debt.
