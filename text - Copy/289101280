IF YOU’RE Cebuano and are fond of posting online photos of yourself, you might be among the 99 per 100,000 individuals who placed Cebu City in the ninth spot on TIME magazine’s “selfiest cities in the world.”TIME placed the cities of Makati and Pasig on the top spot. Other Philippine cities in the top 100 are Baguio (16th), Quezon (59th) and Iloilo (72nd).TIME.com says that it found 1,064 selfies by 787 users in Cebu City with a population of 800,000.This is a far cry from the cities of Makati and Pasig, where 2,915 users posted 4,155 selfies.There 258 selfie-takers per 100,000 individuals in both cities that have about 1.2 million inhabitants.The list is culled from a database built by TIME of more than 402,000 Instagram photos tagged “selfie” that included geographic coordinates and were posted from Jan. 28 to Feb.2, 2014 and from March 3 to 7, 2014.“In total, we ranked 459 cities to determine the selfiest places on earth,” says TIME.com. Time did not include in selfies that did not bear locations.TIME said the degree of selfie-taking also factors in smart phone adoption rates—the percentage of the population that uses smart phones—and median income.Dr. Phoebe Zoe Sanchez, a professor in sociology at the University of the Philippines-Cebu, said taking selfies is a form of expression and a way to cope with challenges.“(A selfie) is a projection of the strong resilience of the individual,” she said.She said that for Cebu City to land on the ninth place, is an indication that Cebuanos remain resilient amid difficult times.Sanchez said some people may consider selfie-takers vain or delusional. But for many, she said, it is also an expression of the Cebuano’s artistic trait.Baguio City has 82 selfie-takers per 100,000 inhabitants while Quezon City has 44 per 100,000 inhabitants. Iloilo City, on the other hand, has 36 selfie-takers out of 100,000 residents.Aside from Makati, Pasig and Cebu, the other Asian cities in the top 10 “selfiest cities” are Petaling Jaya and George Town, both in Malaysia.
