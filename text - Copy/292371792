IIM Calcutta to open international campuses in Dubai and MalaysiaIndian Institute of Management (IIM ) Calcutta is exploring the possibility of setting up campuses in Dubai and in Malaysia soon. According to newspaper reports, the proposal has been discussed with several Board of Governor members and is waiting for a final approval. Currently IIM Indore, IMT Ghaziabad and XLRI among others, have branches in Dubai.Business Schools in the Middle East attract aspirants not wanting to travel all the way to Europe or USA for good quality education. Indian Institutes are also more economical than European or US institutes. IIM Calcutta officials have also mentioned that they are expecting good response to their executive programmes, which are offered on a part time basis to allow people currently working to study side-by-side. The Middle East is also now a host to many corporations, which will enable more opportunities for placements. However, Indian Institutes are required to procure clearance from Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) before setting up international branches.Apart from Dubai, IIM Calcutta is also considering a branch in Malaysia, as Malaysian government representatives had earlier invited IIM Calcutta to open a campus at their upcoming knowledge village. At the time of the initial invite, IIM Calcutta had turned down the request due to shortage of faculty, but now after increasing their teaching force, a Malaysian campus may soon be on the cards. A Singapore campus is not likely as many global business schools have their footprint in Singapore already.
