PERTH: As the search for a missing Malaysian airliner entered its 30th day Sunday, the Australian Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) said it could not as yet confirm that a pulse signal detected in the southern Indian Ocean by a Chinese vessel came from the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight, MH370.JACC chief coordinator Air Chief Marshal (Rtd) Angus Houston said the electronic pulse signal reportedly detected by Haixun 01 “could not be verified at this point of time”.“I have been advised that a series of sounds have been detected by a Chinese ship in the search area.“The characteristics reported are consistent with an aircraft black box,” he said in a statement.He also said that a number of white objects were also reportedly sighted on the surface of the sea about 90 kilometres from where the signal was detected. “However, there is no confirmation at this stage that the signal and the objects are related to the missing aircraft,” he said.Houston said he would provide updates if, and when, more information became available.Flight MH370, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, left the KL International Airport at 12.41 am on March 8 and disappeared from radar screens about an hour later, while over the South China Sea. It was to have arrived in Beijing at 6.30am on the same day.A multinational search was mounted for the aircraft, first in the South China Sea and then, after it was learned that the plane had veered off course, along two corridors – the northern corridor stretching from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, and the southern corridor, from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.Following an unprecedented type of analysis of satellite data, United Kingdom satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat and the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) concluded that Flight MH370 flew along the southern corridor and that its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth, Australia.Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak then announced on March 24, seventeen days after the disappearance of the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, that the flight path of Flight MH370 “ended in the southern Indian Ocean”.-Bernama
