THE shared services and outsourcing (SSO) industry is booming in this region.The Philippines and Malaysia are leading the race while Singapore and other Asean countries are looking to capitalise on the opportunity.According to Malaysia’s national ICT initiative MSC Malaysia, the SSO industry has been a core focus in the country’s aim of transform itselft into a high-income, knowledge-based economy by 2020.The Government, through various policies and incentives is looking to lure global companies to set up shop here. Malaysia has been working to provide modern infrastructure, talent and resources in ICT that includes hardware, software and services as part of its efforts.“Based on a recent study conducted by research company International Data Corporation (IDC), these are the key reasons why Malaysia has the potential to be a regional hub for consolidating finance and accounting operations.The talent pool and the number of existing shared services centres have created a conducive ecosystem that will ensure a consistent growth in terms of service value, as well as the maturity and capability of individuals delivering the services,” MSC Malaysia says in its website.In addition to becoming a valuable source of local employment opportunities and revenue in Malaysia, shared services centres enable the transfer of important skills and competencies to local knowledge workers, as well as exposure to international best-practices and standards.With key support provided by the government, it comes as no surprise that more companies have started making Malaysia their SSO base.IBM recently unveiled its new Global Delivery Centre in Cyberjaya.
