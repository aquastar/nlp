US Navy's Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Pinckney (DDG 91) is also involved search efforts of the missing Malaysia Arlines flight MH370. Three days after the plane with 239 people on board vanished from radar screens between Malaysia and Vietnam, the search effort by at least 34 aircraft and 40 ships was being widened to a 100-nautical mile (115-mile, 185-kilometer) radius from the point the plane was last detected.(AFP/US Navy Photo)Â
