CHENNAI: A 50-year-old man who had promised several people jobs in Malaysia and cheated them of money was nabbed on Sunday. Police said N Habib Ahmed had been evading the net for the past six years.In August 2012, Habib, posing as a job agent, had promised to get Shyam Rajesh Bangara of Navi Mumbai a job in Malaysia and took 26,000 from him. Habib and his aide Kumar got Shyam fake visa papers. At the embassy office, Shyam was told his papers are fake. Following a complaint from Shyam, CCB registered a case and also issued a lookout notice.Acting on a tip, police traced Habib to Egmore and arrested him. During inquiries, he told police that he was also involved in a similar case in 2005, when he duped two people, Shanmugam of Tirupathur and Vishwanathan of Coimbatore, of 11 lakh after promising them jobs in Malaysia.Police issued non bailable warrant after he went absconding in cheating cases.An investigating officer said, "We are now searching for his accomplice Kumar who managed to find youngsters looking for jobs abroad."Police have advised job seekers from contacting private job agents and instead use the government website, www.peoonline.gov.in, to look for job opportunities abroad."Though police officers are trying to create awareness about fake job agents, many continue to fall prey," said a senior police officer.
