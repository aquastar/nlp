Media reports saying Malaysia has ruled out hijacking, mid-air disintegration and radar malfunction as possible reasons behind missing flight MH370 are false, the Chinese embassy in Malaysia told Xinhua on Tuesday.Recent media reports said the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia, Huang Huikang, told reporters Monday that Malaysia had ruled out that five causes, including hijacking, mid-air disintegration and radar malfunction were behind the disappearance of the Boeing 777-200 commercial jet. These media reports were severely mistaken, an embassy official said.The aircraft suddenly vanished from radar early Saturday morning while carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. One hundred and fifty-four passengers were Chinese nationals.Huang said Monday that the priority at the moment is searching for the plane and any speculation over the cause of its disappearance is groundless before the aircraft is found, according to the official.Huang added that the Malaysian authorities have made great efforts in their search for the plane.At a government briefing to Prime Minister Najib Razak, which Huang attended, Malaysian technicians checked and analyzed the usual causes for missing aircraft, such as hijacking, mid-air disintegration and the malfunctioning of electronic systems, but they did not make any conclusions, the official said.
