Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad (left) and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza have been identified as the two passengers traveling on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with stolen passports.As authorities continue to search for clues as to what might have happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, new information about the two passengers on board who traveled with stolen documents may help narrow down theories as to why the plane vanished."The more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident," Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said at a news conference.Investigators have identified the two passengers who purportedly boarded the plane using stolen passports. Authorities investigating the flight revealed Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, a 19-year-old Iranian who was headed to Germany to be with his mother, as one of the individuals that used a stolen passport to board the Beijing-bound aircraft, USA Today reported. According to Malaysian Chief Inspector General Khalis Abu Bakar, Mehrdad’s mother was aware of her son’s travels and use of a stolen passport.The other individual who used a stolen passport to board the jet has been identified as Iranian national Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, age 29.Authorities are still investigating Mohammad Reza’s background but a source has corroborated the notion that the two intended to immigrate to Europe. According to the BBC, a young Iranian in Kuala Lumpur claims his school friend and another Iranian man stayed with him before boarding the Malaysia Airlines flight. He said they planned on settling in Europe.Still many are disappointed in the security breach and Kuala Lumpur Airport’s failure to check passports against Interpol’s database of stolen and lost travel documents. "For years Interpol has asked ‘why should countries wait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates,’" Noble said.Malaysia, however, is not the only one guilty of ignoring this security precaution. CNN reported that in 2013 passengers were able to board planes more than 1 billion times without having their passports checked against Interpol's data. That means about one-third of airplane passengers’ travel documents were not checked in 2013.Though authorities doubt the two passengers in question have any ties to terrorism they aren’t ruling any possibilities out just yet.“All angles are being looked at,” Malaysia Airlines said in a statement, according to USA Today.But until the plane is found there is little chance of discovering exactly what happened to Flight 370, NPR said. The four most probable possibilities are "hijacking, sabotage, personal problems among the crew and passengers, and psychological problems among the crew and passengers," Bakar told reporters.
