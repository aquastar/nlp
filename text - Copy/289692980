Police are combing through the personal, political and religious backgrounds of pilots and crew of a missing Malaysian Airlines jetliner, trying to work out why someone aboard flew the plane hundreds of miles off course.The Boeing 777-200ER disappeared a week ago with 239 people onboard, including six Australians, during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.In the latest twist in the mysterious disappearance, Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said the plane was apparently deliberately diverted and flown for hours after vanishing from radar.He stopped short of confirming a hijack but said the investigation into the aircraft's crew and passengers would be stepped up."We are not ruling out any sort of motivation at the moment," a senior police official with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters.Within hours of Mr Razak's announcement, special branch officers had searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport.An experienced pilot, Mr Zaharie has been described by current and former co-workers as a flying enthusiast who spent his off days operating a life-sized flight simulator he had set up at home."With Zaharie, the flight simulator games were looked at closely," the senior police official said, adding that they appeared to be normal program that allow players to practice flying and landing in different conditions.Postings on his Facebook page suggest the pilot was a politically active opponent of the coalition that has ruled Malaysia for the 57 years since independence.A day before the plane vanished, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was convicted of sodomy and sentenced to five years in prison, in a ruling his supporters and international human rights groups say was politically influenced.Asked if Mr Zaharie's background as an opposition supporter was being examined, the senior police officer would say only: "We need to cover all our bases."Co-pilot Fariq was religious and serious about his career, family and friends said, countering news reports suggesting he was a cockpit Romeo who was reckless on the job.Malaysian police have warned against "jumping to conclusions" regarding their investigation, saying no motive has yet surfaced.Peter Chong, a friend of the pilot, says it is inconceivable Captain Zaharie could have gone rogue and taken over the plane."His character, his personality just doesn't point to that kind of direction," he said."So honestly I'm in a very confused state at this point in time. If you were to fly on a plane and you were given a choice to choose a pilot, Captain Zaharie would be my first choice."At a news conference on Saturday, Mr Razak said investigators believed somebody cut off the plane's communications reporting system, switched off its transponder and steered it west, far from its scheduled route.Electronic signals it continued to exchange periodically with satellites suggest it could have continued flying for nearly seven hours after being last spotted by Malaysian military radar off the country's north-west coast.Satellite data revealed by Mr Razak suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two arcs: one stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern arc heading from Indonesia to the vast southern Indian Ocean.A source familiar with official US assessments said it was thought most likely the plane had headed south into the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed. Air space to the north is much busier, and the plane would likely have been detected.Investigators probing the disappearance of the flight have also piloted an identical Boeing 777-200 on the missing plane's suspected flight path, a senior Malaysian military official said.The revelation provided an insight into the lengths that international investigators who are aiding the Malaysian government are going to in probing the baffling mystery surrounding the fate of the plane.The re-enactment, staged in recent days, was aimed at determining whether the radar and satellite data that it generated matches up with data on MH370's flight."The idea of the flight was to find out the possible direction the missing plane could have gone," the official, who is closely involved in the investigation, told AFP on condition of anonymity.The official said the new findings generated data identical to that which is believed to show the missing airliner turned from its intended flight path across the South China Sea, doubled back across Malaysia, and then veered north-west toward the Andaman Sea.The plane was flown on the same course, including zig-zag moves possibly intended to avoid civilian radar."The plane was flown exactly how the missing plane flew based on military radar data. It did a turn-around, flew across the Malaysian peninsula and up north," the official said."That is why we can conclusively say which two possible directions the plane flew and we have now refocused our search and rescue operations to these two new areas."Meanwhile, India said it was suspending operations around island chains north-west of the Malay Peninsula, at the request of Malaysian officials.Indian defence officials said Malaysia wanted to reassess priorities. Malaysian officials coordinating the search could not be reached for comment.About two-thirds of those on board the plane were Chinese.The missing Australians are Brisbane couple Rod and Mary Burrows, Springfield Lakes couple Robert and Catherine Lawton and Sydney couple Gu Naijun and Li Yuan.Perth-based New Zealand man Paul Weeks was also on the flight, en route to Mongolia to begin a fly-in, fly-out role with mining contractor Transwest.The fact that at least two passengers on board had used stolen passports raised suspicions of foul play, but Interpol says the pair has no link to any terrorist organisations.
