Malaysian military authorities have confirmed an earlier report that they have radar evidence the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 changed course and strayed hundreds of miles away from its planned route over the Gulf of Thailand on the eastern side of Malaysia.Authorities said the plane appeared to have reached the Malacca Strait - the waters between Malaysia's west coast and Indonesia's Sumatra Island.The Gulf of Thailand refers to the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam on the eastern side of the country.According to The Associated Press, a Malaysian newspaper Berita Harian, reported that Malaysian air force chief Gen. Rodzali Daud, said that a military base detected the airliner at about 2:40 a.m. local time near Pulau Perak, an approach to the Malacca Strait.The paper quoted the military chief, saying, "After that, the signal from the plane was lost."Another senior military official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the report, saying that the plane appeared to have been flying low.The latest statement from the Malaysian military follows earlier unconfirmed reports emanating also from military sources that the aircraft appeared to have attempted to reverse course about one hour into its flight over the Gulf of Thailand.Officials, however, expressed surprise that the pilot would attempt to change course without informing air control.Following the new information from the Malaysian military, investigating authorities said Tuesday that after having failed to find debris of the airplane in the Gulf of Thailand they are expanding their search for the missing airplane to the Malacca Strait.The plan ultimately is to search the entire expanse of the area where the plane could have reached with the amount of fuel it had.This is a vast area and it may take several weeks to cover all possible locations.Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur on the western coast of Malaysia. En route to Beijing, China, it flew northeastward across Malaysia at an altitude of 35,000 feet into the Gulf of Thailand where it disappeared from radar about an hour into its flight, without sending any distress signals.Authorities have searched the expanse of water between Malaysia and Vietnam with more than 40 planes and ships from up to 10 different countries.The Associated Press reports that Malaysiaâ€™s civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said the search continues on the western and eastern sides of the country.It seems likely, however, that more resources will be committed to searching the waters of the Malacca Strait.
