Malaysia Airlines says it is “shocked” about new allegations raised against the first officer of the still-missing flight 370.The Oneworld Alliance carrier’s statement comes hours after photos and video showed a Malaysia pilot identified as first officer Fariq Ab Hamid entertaining tourists inside the cockpit of previous flights.Hamid was serving as the first officer on the Boeing 777-200 that disappeared off the coast of Malaysia while en route to Beijing early on 8 March.Malaysia says it takes the allegations against Hamid “very seriously”, although it has not yet confirmed whether they are true.“As you are aware, we are in the midst of a crisis, and we do not want our attention to be diverted,” the carrier says in a statement.Hamid, 27, had accumulated 2,800 flight hours with Malaysia since 2007.The allegation was made on an Australian tabloid TV programme called A Current Affair.Australian Jonti Roos says she and her friend were invited into the cockpit by Hamid and allowed to stay for the entirety of 1h-long flight in December 2011 from Phuket, Thailand to Kuala Lumpur.Roos also claims that Hamid and another pilot who has not been identified smoked in the cockpit during the flight.
