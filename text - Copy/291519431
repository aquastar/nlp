GEORGE TOWN: The Penang state government will consider implementing water rationing, at its next executive committee (exco) meeting on April 2, said chief minister Lim Guan Eng."Although the government had announced earlier that it would not do so, the exco will review the situation next week," he said in a statement here today.Lim also expressed his disappointment with the increase in water consumption despite numerous conservation programmes to raise awareness and even surcharges for wastage."Last year Penang recorded the highest water consumption in Malaysia, at 285 cubic litres per person daily. And as of March 1 this year, it has already gone up by 5.4%, which is 311 cubic litres per person daily," he noted.He urged the public to conserve water and not waste the precious resource as their rate of consumption was now almost 50% higher than the national average rate of 215 cubic litres per person daily."We can stretch our water reserves by 50% if we can conserve and only use the same amount as the national average rate," he said. â€“ Bernama
