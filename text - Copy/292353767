BANGKOK - Authorities coordinating the international search from Australia for a missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet say underwater signals have been heard three times since Friday.The transmissions could be from the aircraft's data and voice recorders.Australian, Chinese and Malaysian officials are cautioning that reports from ships of underwater signals in the Indian Ocean do not mean that the location of Flight 370 has been determined.In Perth, Australia, the search's chief coordinator, Angus Houston, tells reporters nothing is yet verified.He said, "This is an important and encouraging lead but one which I urge you to continue to treat carefully. We are working in a very big ocean and within a very large search area. And, so far, since the aircraft went missing we've had very few leads which allow us to narrow the search area."The potential breakthrough, however, the retired Australian air force chief confirms, is prompting the diversion of ships and planes to the area where the Chinese patrol vessel Haixun-01 detected acoustic pulses on Friday and Saturday in waters up to 4.5 kilometers deep.Houston said, "At the moment, the data we have does not provide a means of verification. We have to do further investigation on the site itself."Signals on a frequency of 37.5 kilohertz were detected two kilometers apart by the Chinese ship.Authorities say an Australian vessel, the Ocean Shield, several hundred kilometers away and carrying a sophisticated U.S. Navy pinger locator, also heard a faint signal on the same frequency. It is to listen for more underwater sounds at its current location before heading to the spot where the Chinese patrol ship's hydrophone detected something.A British Royal Navy vessel, the HMS Echo, last week detected a similar signal that turned out to be false.The batteries for the locator beacon of the missing plane's black box are due to run out at any time.So far, all sightings of debris in the southern Indian Ocean have been determined to not be from the missing Boeing 777.A dozen planes and 13 ships are continuing to search.The Malaysia Airlines jet veered off course after departing Kuala Lumpur on a scheduled flight to Beijing on March 8. It was carrying 227 passengers - mostly Chinese - plus a crew of 12.Investigators say they do not know whether the plane was hijacked or otherwise deliberately diverted by one of the two pilots.Mechanical problems have not been eliminated as a cause, but investigators say they believe the plane's flight management system was re-programmed. After the plane's transponder was shut off, the jet turned back towards Malaysia and then stayed in an established flight corridor.An analysis of routine pings from the engines to a satellite led investigators to conclude the aircraft ran out of fuel over the southern India Ocean
