It would also offer a swift and lucrative exit for US buyout firms TPG and Carlyle Group Ltd which paid A$1.99 billion for Healthscope in 2010.Healthscope executives and lead bankers Macquarie Group Ltd and UBS AG recently met potential buyers in Asia, the person familiar with the matter said, adding that TPG and Carlyle had set a deadline for indicative bids in April.TPG and Carlyle are also considering taking Healthcare public, said the person who declined to be identified due to the confidentiality of the process.News of the potential IHH purchase was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.When asked to comment, IHH said in a statement that it was “always looking at various value accretive opportunities to add to its portfolio”. TPG and Carlyle declined to comment.Earlier this year, Healthscope said it was considering several options for a sale process to cash in on strong demand for quality healthcare assets.Stocks in Australian private health operators have surged so far this year, with Ramsay Health Care Ltd up almost 14 per cent and Sonic Healthcare Ltd gaining over 7 per cent, compared to a 1 per cent gain in the broader index.IHH is 45 per cent owned by Malaysian sovereign fund Khazanah Nasional and joint-listed in Malaysia and Singapore.
