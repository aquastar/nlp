The inaugural Walk for Autism received tremendous support from the public with over 1,000 people participating in the event, Saturday.Organising Chairwoman Jacqueline Lingham said she was surprised by the response."We have created a big impact as you can see todayÃ‰I only aimed for at least 500 participants for the walk but thanks to God, it's more than what I expected."We want to organise this programme annually in conjunction with the World Autism month of April every year and hope that the number of participants will increase. "I want to thank the government hospitals and private hospitals around the city, schools and other agencies that gave their cooperation to make this event successful," she said.Lingham said there were also participants from Labuan and Kota Belud in the two-kilometre walk which was flagged off at 4pm at Perdana Park Tanjung Aru, here.The participants walked through historical Hone Place and back to Perdana Park and lots of activities awaited them after the walk such as zumba, concert and so on.The event, organised by the Child Sabah Association aimed to create a platform for families of individuals with autism to network, support and give hope to families of individuals with autism who at times feel isolated and alone.Some of the funds raised from the walk would be contributed to two other organisations working with autistic children.
