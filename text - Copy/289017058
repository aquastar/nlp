The mystery of Malaysia Airlines (MAS) Flight 370's disappearance further deepens as relatives attempt to call the mobile phones of loved ones on the plane.A video on the Mirror Online website shows a Chinese woman calling her brother, one of the 239 passengers aboard the MAS Boeing 777. The commercial passenger jet mysteriously vanished from radars after flying 100 miles from its takeoff point in Kuala Lumpur.The phone rang, but no one answered.Other passengers' phones were reported to have been called by family members with the same outcome: unanswered ringing tones.Bian Lingwei, one of the passengers' sisters, said in an interview reported on the International Business Times, "This morning, around 11:40 [am], I called my older brother's number twice, and I got the ringing tone.""If I could get through, the police could locate the position, and there's a chance he could still be alive," she continued.Another man called his brother in the presence of journalists; the phone connected three times and then appeared to hang up, Shanghai Daily reported.Malaysia Airlines commercial director Hugh Dunleavy, in response to the passengers' families' reports, said that crew members' phones were also ringing when the airline attempted to contact them.The phone numbers have been turned over to authorities for investigation, with families of the missing passengers requesting that the locations of the phones be traced via GPS.A petition from 19 families of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was submitted to the airline, declaring that their loved ones' phones were ringing. The petition, China.org.cn reports, requested Malaysia Airlines to investigate further on the incident and give them an explanation on why the phones were ringing if they could not locate the plane.When the petitioners were unsatisfied with Malaysia Airlines' response, they angrily threw water bottles at the MAS spokesman, vowing to stage a protest if they don't get answers soon.If the phones were, indeed, ringing and reachable, then it may rule out the possibility of a crash or explosion.Could the plane still be intact? Could the passengers and crew still be alive?Theories behind the plane's disappearance abound, including the possibility of a terrorist plot, but, as of this writing, investigations are still ongoing.
