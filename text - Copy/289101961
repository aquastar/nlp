BERLIN: German carrier Lufthansa, which is launching a direct non-stop flight service from Frankfurt to Kuala Lumpur on March 30, is upbeat about Malaysia as its future market.Lufthansa Group senior vice-president (head of international affairs and government affairs) Thomas Kropp told Bernama at the International Tourism Bourse (ITB) here that Lufthansa had “studied the dynamic growth market of Malaysia before taking the decision to start a non-stop service to Kuala Lumpur and, thence, to Jakarta”.“Malaysia is a dynamic, fast-growing economy which is an attractive factor for us. We will start with four weekly flights to Kuala Lumpur but will later increase to five flights a week from June,” Kropp said.Lufthansa had, until now, served the Malaysian market through Bangkok but the growing business and tourism traffic between Malaysia and Germany was one of the reasons that motivated the carrier to take a closer look at the business potential inherent in Malaysia.The airline announced its plan to launch the Kuala Lumpur service three months ago.“Trade and tourism traffic is growing and, in our view, will grow further. Kuala Lumpur is a good trading point and, because of its strategic location, offers good connectivity to other cities such as Jakarta, Manila and Ho Chin Minh City,” he said.Kropp also called on Malaysian Tourism Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Nazri Abdul Aziz at the Malaysian Pavilion at the ITB Berlin for an exchange of views.Like other European airlines, Lufthansa is also closely monitoring the moves by a number of Gulf carriers which, some German analysts say, are fast expanding and pulling the rug from under the feet of other carriers because of the availability of cheaper fuel and other advantages.The Gulf carriers have also penetrated into the Malaysian market and are carving out a larger market share in that country.“The Gulf carriers do not have their own markets and are building over-capacities by increasing the number of flights.“The global aviation market is growing by 4% to 5% whereas these carriers are growing at a much higher rate. We believe not only in free trade but also in fair trade,” said Kropp, who called for a “level playing field.”He said Malaysia and Germany were both free economies and generated considerable synergies, adding that German business people and investors preferred direct connectivity with Malaysia.Industries in Germany views Asia as the world’s fastest growing continent, with South-East Asia playing a crucial role in this growth trajectory.Lufthansa is also “very upbeat” about the creation of the Asean Economic Community (AEC) in 2015.The AEC would open up “new perspectives and offer greater opportunities,” Kropp said. — Bernama
