Wei-Ling Gallery owner Lim Wei-Ling believes that now is the right time for the rise of Asian art. — Pictures by K.E. OoiGEORGE TOWN, April 7 — If ever there was a “perfect” time for Asian artists to make a name for themselves, it is now.In the last decade or so, art collectors from both the West and the East have turned away from traditional European and contemporary American art towards Asian art.They are starting to take note of the vibrancy, colours and cultural nuances depicted by Asian artists and buying emerging art masterpieces in Asia.Highly excited by this growing interest and its implications for Asian artists, particularly South-east Asian and Malaysian artists, art gallery director Lim Wei-Ling said this will be the age of Asian art due to the still affordable prices of these pieces now.“We still have masterpieces that cost US$30,000 (RM97,000), US$40,000 and even maybe US$80,000 which is affordable when we compare it to American contemporaries that go for nothing less than a few million dollars,” she said.This rising interest in Asian art has been gathering momentum slowly since the early 2000s and in 2011 alone, US$13 billion worth of Asian art was sold at auction houses.A case in point, premier auction house Sotheby’s has seen the potential and is opening up a joint-venture auction house in China with a Chinese partner.In China, foreign auction houses are not allowed to set up shop unless they partner with a local auction house.Lim, who was in Penang recently to deliver a talk on the rise of Asian art at her own gallery in the E & O Hotel, noted that as of today, 45 per cent of art auctions conducted worldwide are done in Hong Kong and China.“I’m using China as my main reference point because Chinese art has a huge presence in the market, not to mention the huge numbers of Chinese art collectors,” she said.The China art scene has matured to the point where there are now Chinese paintings being sold at prices as high as US$10 million while South-east Asian artworks are still in the lower range of US$35,000 and below.The demand for South-east Asian art is proven when Sotheby’s achieved total sales of HK$200 million (RM84.24 million) for South-east Asian paintings in October last year, more than double the HK$82.8 million sale made in 2011A contemporary artist’s work that tells the nuances of our time now.This is good news for South-east Asian artists because collectors see the potential in their art which is comparatively cheaper and of good quality too.“Our local collectors, not only those based here but also those based elsewhere, are very supportive of local artwork and this is the main driving force pushing South-east Asian art into the international art scene,” Lim said.“Foreign art collectors are just starting to trickle but once they come in full force and start collecting Asian art in earnest, the market will fly and South-east Asian contemporary artists may finally hit the seven- to eight-figure category.”Lim said local Asian art collectors who bought Malaysian artworks about a decade ago, pieces that cost them between RM3,000 and RM5,000 each, will be glad to find out that some of these artworks have appreciated in value to between RM20,000 and RM30,000 each.Malaysian artist Ivan Lam’s success is a fine example, she said.His paintings were sold between RM7,000 and RM8,000 each a decade ago but in the last two years, his works are being sold at about RM200,000 per piece.Of course, this doesn’t mean every Malaysian and South-east Asian artist is going to make it big and become famous artists overnight.Collectors, though drawn to the reasonable price tags here, are still a very discerning lot who will only pick from the best of the best.“What’s important for local artists to remember is to capture the soul, the feelings and the essence of the time we’re living in in their own way and their artwork will be appreciated,” Lim said.Artists who truly express themselves in their work instead of painting something “to please the audience” will be the ones who will ride this new wave of interest in Asian art, she added.Wei-Ling Gallery represents about 12 local contemporary artists with the potential to produce relevant pieces that collectors seek.Wei-Ling Gallery opened in Penang to bring contemporary art to the northern state.The gallery, with its headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, decided to set up a branch in Penang late last year with the objective of bringing more contemporary art to the northern state.Find out more about the gallery here.
