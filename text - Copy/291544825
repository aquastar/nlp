Britain, the United States and Australia will press for a leading role in the investigation into the missing flight MH370 amid concerns that Malaysia is not capable of conducting the investigation alone.Representatives from the three countries are asking Malaysia to agree that wreckage recovered from the lost Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER aircraft be examined in Australia and that, if the aircraft’s vital flight data recorders are recovered, their contents be downloaded and analysed in Australia with help from Britain and the US.Officials travelled to Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, at the weekend to put the Australian Government’s view.
