KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA â€” The search area for a missing jetliner has expanded with Malaysian Airlines saying the western coast of the country is now the focus of the hunt.That is on the other side of Malaysia from where flight MH370 was reported missing.In a statement Tuesday, an official said the hunt had expanded beyond the flight path, and the "focus is on the West Peninsular of Malaysia at the Straits of Malacca."Civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said search teams continued to look in both areas.Vietnam's deputy military chief says he had ordered a land search for the plane up to the country's border with Laos and Cambodia.The announcements reflect the difficulty authorities are having in finding the Boeing 777 which had 239 people on board when it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.It vanished from radar screens between Malaysia and Vietnam early Saturday with no distress signal.The search effort, involving at least 34 aircraft and 40 ships from several countries, has found no signs of debris.On Monday, authorities questioned travel agents at a beach resort in Thailand about two men who boarded the plane with stolen passports, part of a growing international investigation into what they were doing on the flight.It's not known whether the two men had anything to do with the plane's disappearance. Criminals and illegal migrants regularly travel on fake or stolen documents.Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said biometric information and CCTV footage of the men has been shared with Chinese and U.S. intelligence agencies.
