KAJANG: MCA deputy president Datuk Wee Ka Siong yesterday rapped PKR leaders for using dirty tactics by twisting the facts to tarnish credibility of Barisan Nasional (BN) candidate for the Kajang by-election, Datin Paduka Chew Mei Fun, in issues concerning Chinese schools.Wee said MCA would never pawn Chinese schools if Chew, who is also MCA vice-president, managed to win the state seat in the by-election on March 23, as alleged by PKR leaders.Instead, he said PKR leaders had purposely questioned Chew’s credibility when she was the MP for Petaling Jaya Utara in solving the issue concerning Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Cina (SJKC) Damansara.“When she was the Petaling Jaya Utara MP, it was her and Datuk Seri Hishamuddin Tun Hussein, the then Education Minister, who were responsible for relocating the school to a bigger site,” Wee told a press conference here yesterday.PKR vice-president Tian Chua and deputy treasurer-general Low Chee Chong on Saturday launched an attack on Chew’s credibility, claiming that she had failed to solve the SJK(C) Damansara issue and that she would close down Chinese schools in Kajang if given the mandate in the by-election.Meanwhile, Chew also expressed disappointment with the allegation made by PKR leaders and asked voters in Kajang not to fall for it.“I personally received my early and primary education in a national-type Chinese school before pursuing my secondary education at Kuen Cheng private school … how can I ever do that (close down Chinese school)?“I will always find a way to strengthen and harmonise Chinese culture with other cultures in the country because we have a peaceful and harmonious Malaysian society,” she said.closed in 2001 after the government built a new building for the school in Jalan Tropicana, Petaling Jaya upon request from the school’s Parents-Teacher Association based on student safety, health and convenience factors.However, in 2008, the Education Ministry had allowed SJKC Damansara to be ‘reopened’ so that the original site be used by any SJKC with student shortage.In Hulu Terengganu, Terengganu BN election machinery chief Datuk Jailani Johari said 40 of its members had been deployed to Kajang to help ensure victory for Chew in the by-election.“I’m confident that with hard work and commitment showed by the candidate, the supporters and the acceptance from the Tionghua community, we can win this for BN,” he told reporters here.Jailani, who is also Deputy Communication and Multimedia Minister, also said they had identified 12 Kajang voters in Terengganu and would do their best to gain their support and votes in the by-election.“We have identified these voters and will do our level best for the BN candidate,” he said.The by-election is being called after its incumbent Lee Chin Cheh of PKR resigned on Jan 27. Chew is facing a straight fight against PKR president Datin Seri Dr Wan Azizah Ismail. — Bernama
