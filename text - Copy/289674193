KUALA LUMPUR: Police are focusing their probe on the crew members of the ill-fated MH370 after several intelligence agencies helping with the probe cleared all 227 passengers of involvement in the disappearance of the aircraft.Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said police are seeking more information on the passengers from other international intelligence agencies."If anything crops up, then we will look into it," he told reporters at a packed press conference at the Sama-Sama Hotel here.Khalid said the case of the missing aircraft is being investigated for possible hijacking and sabotage and acts of terrorism under Section 130 (c) of the Penal Code.He said investigations are still focusing on the possibility of hijack, sabotage and personal and psychological problems of crew and passengers.He said the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 will be applied in the probe.On reports that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah's family had moved out of their home prior to the plane going missing, he said they are untrue."Nobody moved out. We are investigating the pilots, crew and ground crew as well. Police have searched the pilots' homes and have seized equipment to aid in the investigation. The flight simulator is now with us and has been reassembled to be further analysed by our experts," he said.Meanwhile, Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein said the absence of a ransom demand has made it more difficult for those involved in the search for MH370.He said the government is still in the dark over the disappearance of the aircraft as there is no specific demand made by any party, with background checks on the 227 passengers clearing them of any link to foul play involving the missing aircraft.Hishamuddin said both the pilot and co-pilot had not asked to be on duty together but were assigned according to the company's routine work order.On claims of Interpol's help being refused in the early stages of the probe and that the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) also allegedly not being approached for its expertise, both Hishammuddin and Khalid denied the claims."The claim is not true. We have been working with all intelligence agencies internationally from the start," Hishammuddin said.He said investigations also showed that standard operating procedures (SOP) of airport security and Immigration Department were not breached."As the personnel from Malaysia Airlines and Immigration Department explained, all procedures were adhered to, and there was no breach. This was just an unprecedented case," he said.Asked if he is concerned with lax airport security in Malaysia, Hishammuddin said measures will be taken to tighten it if there is a need.
