They held a press briefing in the capital today and briefed the media on developments on the search for the missing plane.  They’ve confirmed that investigators have visited the home of the pilot and co-pilot to interview their families and collect evidence.  The flight from Kuala Lampur to Beijing last Saturday disappeared off civilian radar with 239 people on board.  Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, “The search area has been significantly expanded and the nature of the search changed from focusing on shallow seas to large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries and deep, remote oceans.”  This week authorities confirmed the aircraft had been deliberately steered off course by someone on the plane.
