Chinese planes have spotted objects in the Indian Ocean bearing the same colors as the missing Malaysia Airlines jet.Investigators, however, say those objects and others that have been pulled from the water cannot be confirmed as debris from the jet.Ships and planes Sunday headed to the new search area, about 1,850 kilometers off the western Australian city of Perth.The search shifted more than 1,000 kilometers northeast Friday when investigators determined the plane flew faster and burned fuel more quickly than previously estimated. This means the jet did not fly as far as believed.The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is now into its fourth week.Relatives of the 239 people on board are refusing to give up hope. They are demanding answers from the Malaysian government, accusing officials of withholding vital information. Some of the family members are flying from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur Sunday to seek answers from Malaysian officials. Most of the people on board the jet were Chinese.Malaysian Defense Minister Hishamuddin Hussein has told the families searchers are doing whatever it takes to find the plane.The Boeing 777 disappeared March 8, thousands of kilometers west of its intended flight path. The jet took off from Kuala Lumpur and was headed to Beijing.Officials believe the aircraft crashed into the southern Indian Ocean, far from land. They have not ruled out any cause, including terrorism or a hijacking.
