Almost 30 years after the Memali massacre, families of the 18 casualties want closure. – The Malaysian Insider pic by Hasnoor Hussain, April 6, 2014. More than a week after Tun Musa Hitam’s disclosure that former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad was in the country when the Memali incident occurred, DAP today repeated its call for a Royal Commission of Inquiry to probe into the 1985 incident.Party adviser Lim Kit Siang said the former deputy prime minister’s revelations were sufficient grounds to establish a RCI.On March 28, Musa, who was also the home minister during the Memali incident, revealed that Dr Mahathir was in the country at that time.For decades, it had been reported that Musa had been in charge of operations as Dr Mahathir was reportedly visiting China during the Memali incident."The families of the 18 people who died in the Memali incident deserve closure as it has been a festering wound for the past 30 years," Lim said."Ibrahim Libya, 13 villagers and four policemen died in the incident. Their families have been haunted by not knowing the truth," he said."In particular, the families want to know who were responsible for the 18 deaths during the Memali incident."Lim said Malaysians were entitled to know the truth about one of the biggest “blots” in Malaysia's history."Who countermanded the instructions issued by Musa to the police to avoid violence and bloodshed while arresting Ibrahim?"There is only one person who is more senior than Musa in his capacity as the deputy PM and home minister at that point in time."Did Dr Mahathir countermand Musa's directive to the police? If he did not, will he support the establishment of a RCI?"Lim said the Memali incident was the first in a series of deplorable events during Dr Mahathir's 22 years as prime minister."(He was also responsible) for the emasculation of national institutions in terms of professionalism, independence and integrity as they lost their political impartiality.""It covers the police, judiciary, Attorney General's Chambers, Election Commission, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and the civil service.”He said an RCI would provide closure to the incident and could include compensation to the families of the 18 casualties. – April 6, 2014.
