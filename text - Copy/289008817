The elderly parents of one of the Australian passengers onboard the missing Malaysian jetliner have spoken of their heartache, as investigations into the plane's disappearance continue.Rodney and Mary Burrows were among six Australians onboard the plane that disappeared five days ago.The couple were hoping to celebrate their retirement with a trip to China.The Burrows family say they are praying for a miracle.An emotional Irene and George Burrows were met by other family members at Brisbane airport this morning.They say they no longer expect their son and daughter-in-law, Rod and Mary Burrows, to be found alive, but they do want to know what happened to the plane."There is no news whatsoever," Mrs Burrows said."It's just disappeared off the face of the Earth and if we could just find some wreckage or something it would be a help probably, but not this."She said earlier today her heart was aching."Nobody can believe this has happened," Irene Burrows said from her home at Biloela, west of Gladstone in central Queensland."This happens to other people - not the likes of us who have a son and daughter on a plane that wouldn't hurt or harm anybody and were just a loving couple in their own ways."Mrs Burrows says the family is finding it hard to deal with."Why was it that plane? There are thousands up there a day," she said."Just waiting for some sort of news - if they've found the wreckage or if they can tell us how can a plane just disappear?"Mrs Burrows says she spoke to Rodney a couple of days before the couple left on their trip."He was very excited about going," she said."It's not their first overseas trip, but it was planned for a long time."The couple says the family is not planning to fly to Malaysia."Not unless something is found," Mrs Burrows said."The Malaysian airways have offered flights and things."Authorities are scouring the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and Vietnam, and land along the Malay Peninsula for signs of the missing Boeing 777.
