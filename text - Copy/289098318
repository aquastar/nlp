The guided-missile destroyer Kidd has joined efforts to find the missing Malaysian Air Flight MH370, which disappeared on Saturday while enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, according to 7th Fleet.So far, no U.S. Navy ships or aircraft have spotted any debris associated with aircraft wreckage, said said 7th Fleet spokesman Lt. David Levy.We've seen media reports that a window or door fragment from a plane had been spotted, but I can't confirm any of those reports, Levy said in an email Tuesday to Navy Times.Helicopters from the Kidd and the destroyer Pinckney are looking for the missing plane in the Gulf of Thailand, Levy said. A Navy P-3C Orion aircraft is searching in area west of Malaysia in the northern Straits of Malacca and Andaman Sea.Each HM-60R helicopter can typically search an area between 400 and 600 square nautical miles in a 3.5-hour sortie, while a P-3C can search between 1,000 and 1,500 square piles per hour and it has sensors that can detect small debris in the water, Levy said.The search efforts are being directed by the Blue Ridge, 7th Fleets command ship, which is somewhere between Hong Kong and the Philippines right now, 7th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. William Marks said in an email to Navy Times on Tuesday.Despite several nations taking part in the search for the missing passenger plane, none has recovered any debris that could be from the Boeing 777, according to media reports. An oil slick on the ocean which searchers thought could be from the plane turned out not to be aviation fuel. Other leads have likewise not panned out.
