On Monday, March 24, more than two weeks after its disappearance, the fate of the missing Malaysian jet was finally concluded.  Based on a new analysis of satellite data, the missing Malaysia Airlines plane had crashed into a rather remote area of the Indian Ocean.Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced to reporters that the satellite data proved that the pilot had flown the plane carrying 226 passengers and 13 crewmembers "to a remote location, far from any possible landing sites.... [and] ended in the southern Indian Ocean." Although there has been much speculation that the pilots purposely caused the crash due to issues related to their mental health, investigators have not yet ruled out mechanical or electrical failure, hijacking, sabotage, or terrorism.Prior to the Prime Minister's announcement, Malaysia Airlines chose to send a mass text message to the family members of the passengers on the flight. The text read: "Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived.  As you will hear in the next hour from Malaysia's Prime Minister, we must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the Southern Indian Ocean."CTV's Asian Bureau Chief Janis Mackey Fryer reported, "To have the final confirmation after two-plus weeks of waiting, of holding vigils, of believing that there was a shred of hope that there were going to be survivors found, to get the news by text message perhaps underscored and punctuated the blow."The fact that the Airlines found it appropriate to deliver through text message such devastating news about the tragic loss of lives is completely appalling.  Understandably, a text message may be the quickest and most efficient means to reach many people instantaneously; however, the impersonal and faceless nature of delivering such a heartbreaking message is completely unacceptable.Today's technology has lead to fewer and fewer interpersonal relationships and conversations.  Texting or Facebook messaging has proved the more favorable means of communication over face-to-face meetings or even phone calls; however, I find it had to believe that any sensible person would find it adequate to deliver news of the death of a loved one via text message.  Malaysia Airlines took a cowardly approach to delivering the news to their lost passenger's family members and for that they must take responsibility.
