Investigators remain "puzzled" by the strange incident involving the Boeing 777 that vanished over the weekend with no trace to be found.Flight MH370 from the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in China was carrying 239 people on board and now authorities are fearing the worst.And now dozens of conspiracy theories have been talked about online with some likening it to that of the Bermuda Triangle.The theories come with as many as 19 families coming forward to tell authorities that their friends and family member's phones are still ringing.They are calling for experts to try to track the GPS to where the stranded passengers may be.The discovery has given hope to the survival of those on board.But it has thrown away any suggestions the plane came down in the sea with the electronics likely to have been destroyed.Or even if it has crash landed with the impact surely destroying the devices.But another issue worrying investigators is a pilot flying in front of MH370 yesterday said he heard "mumbling" from the cock pit of the plane.The unnamed pilot reportedly claimed the last time he heard from the aircraft there was "a lot of interference".Interpol have released an image of two Iranians who were using stolen passports on the missing jet.Authorities named the two men as Pouri Nourmohammadi, 19, and Delavar Seyedmohammaderza, 29.Any other clues of the whereabouts of the plane still remain unknown.
