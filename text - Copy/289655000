China's state news agency Xinhua attacked Malaysia's handling of the investigation into the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on Saturday as China has urged Malaysia to continue providing more "thorough and correct information" about the plane that is now believed to have been deliberately steered off course.Xinhua said yesterday that "massive efforts have been squandered, and numerous rumors have been spawned, repeatedly racking the nerves of the awaiting families".The report likewise criticized Malaysia's reluctance to share information "in a full and timely manner" as family members have grown impatient and desperate for news."Instead of simply giving a 'no comment' response, they should share all the information they know with the Chinese government," another Xinhua report said."After all, Malaysia and China are the two hardest-hit countries in this crisis."Malaysian police yesterday searched the home of the 53-year-old MH370 pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah after the country's prime minster Najib Razak announced at a press conference that investigations would refocus on crew and passengers onboard the plane.  The prime minister said that there is a "high degree of certainty" that the data reporting system of MH370 was disabled before the plane reached the east coast of Malaysia and that the activity was "consistent with the deliberate action by someone on the plane".A source close to the investigation told CNN that Malaysian police had indeed searched the home of Shah, who lives in an upscale gated community outside of Kuala Lumpur.Two vans were loaded with small bags outside of the home of co-pilot Fariq Abdul, 27, who fell under public scrutiny after photos recently surfaced showing the co-pilot "posing for pictures" with a passenger mid-flight. It's unclear if the bags were taken from his home and police made no comment on it.China, meanwhile, has called on Malaysia to increase intensity of the search for the missing aircraft carrying 239 people, including 154 Chinese passengers."It is the eighth day since MH370 lost contact with its radar signal and time is life," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a press release."We urge Malaysia to expand and define the search area for the missing plane and increase the intensity of the search," Qin said.
