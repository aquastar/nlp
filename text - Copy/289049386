SEPANG: The two men who boarded flight MH370 using stolen passports have been identified as Iranians – Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, 19, and Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza, 29.Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar, who named Pouria as the first imposter, ruled out the possibility of him having terrorist connections.Interpol secretary-general Ronald K. Noble identified Delavar as the second imposter.He made the announcement at a press conference in France, which was aired by CNN news today.Khalid said Pouria was ostensibly on his way to Germany, where his mother lives.“We have done a background check on him with other international authorities and we believe it is not likely he is a terrorist,” he said.He said police had spoken to Pouria’s mother, who said that she had been waiting for him to arrive and had contacted the authorities when he failed to turn up.“She knows he is travelling with a stolen passport and alerted the authorities when he failed to arrive,” Khalid told a press conference at the KL International Airport here today.Khalid said it is not known if Delavar, the second passenger travelling on a stolen Italian passport, is linked to Pouria.Khalid said police are investigating the case of the missing aircraft from four angles: hijacking, an act of sabotage, psychological problems of passengers and crew and personal problems of passengers and crew.“We are exploring all possible situations, and will not rule out any possibilities.“These four areas will be the main focus, and other angles like mechanical problems of the aircraft will also be investigated by the airport authorities and MAS,” he said.He added that all the areas under investigation were equally important.
