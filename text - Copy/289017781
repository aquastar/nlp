BY any measure, it can be described as a landslide on Mount Paektu.According to North Korean state media, Kim Jong-un, the country's youthful 'supreme leader', took 100pc of the vote on a 100pc turnout to win the parliamentary seat for the sacred mountain where his father, Kim Jong-il, was supposedly born."All the voters of the constituency took part in voting and 100pc of them voted for Kim Jong-un," reported KCNA, the official news outlet, adding that the result underlined "people's absolute support and profound trust in supreme leader Kim Jong-un as they single-mindedly remain loyal to him, holding him in high esteem".The fact that there was no opponent probably helped.There was only one, regime-approved candidate in each of the 687 constituencies for Sunday's election to the Supreme People's Assembly, the virtually powerless rubberstamp parliament that meets once a year. It was technically possible to vote "No," but people so inclined had to enter a special booth. In reality, such an act was unthinkable – North Korea routinely executes or imprisons dissidents.State media described the election, held once every five years, as a crucial democratic step that would help to transform "the socialist country into the best thriving nation in the world and a paradise for the people under the wise leadership of Kim Jong-un". All North Koreans voted, "except for those on foreign tour or working in oceans", said KCNA.It claimed that observers from Britain, Nigeria, Mongolia and Indonesia had been able to witness proceedings in Pyongyang and had reached "a correct understanding of the election system".Experts said voters were effectively herded to the polls by neighbourhood committees.
