We must give our support, and insya-Allah (God willing) what we pray for is some information that can finally lead us to the discovery of the aircraft soon,” he said.When interviewed by the TV station, Alhijrah today, Najib said that for the Muslims, they were taught to accept the fact that everything was decided by Allah, and they must accept fate.“We must face this great challenge from Allah calmly, we must try our level best, with all the resources and strength that we have. This is what the government is doing,” the prime minister said.Najib said despite the availability of sophisticated technology, Muslims must eventually accept that they were merely normal human beings who were weak and small.“The Boeing 777 is actually among the most sophisticated aircraft with very good track record. We have all the experience in handling the aircraft, but eventually we have to accept that we are normal human beings who are weak and small, to Allah we submit,” he said.The prime minister said he too understood the feelings of the family members of the passengers and crew members concerned who would not be satisfied unless they received accurate news on the fate of their loved ones.“The families concerned must also realise that the incident was totally unexpected and we must understand that all efforts were being carried out with diligence.“Nevertheless as Muslims, we must accept the fact that Allah determines everything. The challenge from Allah comes no matter when, even in times of happinness or in distress,” he said.Najib pointed out that the government, with the assistance of nine other countries worldwide and equipped with sophisticated technology, were going all out to track down the missing aircraft.“The government is doing everything (including) to increase assets, aircraft and ships with sophisticated equipment, with sonar and so on and hopefully I am certain we will eventually find it InsyaAllah (with God's grace)."The question is when, but under the present situation, we must have patience and pray,” he said.The MAS Flight MH370, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, went missing enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing about an hour after taking off from the KL International Airport at 12.41 am Saturday.It should have landed in Beijing at 6.30am.  — Bernama
