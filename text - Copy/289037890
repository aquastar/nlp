The family of a passenger onboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has to deal with disturbing rumours being circulated in the social media about the plane.Kranti Shirsath, 44, a former chemistry lecturer, is one of the five Indian passengers traveling on the Beijing-bound plane before it went missing last Saturday.Her brother-in-law Satish Shirsath told Indian news portal dnaindia.com that their family had been disturbed by messages and pictures on Whatsapp and social media sites, claiming the plane had been hijacked."As soon as we came to know about the messages, we had been contacting the (Malaysian) embassy for clarification. We were told that there were only rumours."We have made 15 to 20 calls to the embassy since this morning," he said, adding that although the embassy staff had been approachable, the family could no longer sit at home and wait for news.Satish said his family had been disappointed each time they contacted the embassy because there was little for them to learn about what happened to MH370 and Kranti, a mother of two.“Now we have decided to send two of our relatives to Malaysia so we can get information," he said.He said that his family has not given up hope, adding that they continued to pray while checking all sources for any information on the search for MH370.Kranti was going to Beijing to meet up with her husband Pralhad Shirsath, who works in Pyongyang, North Korea, according to IBNlive.com.Her teenage son, Rahul, who will be sitting for a school exam, said he remembered his last communication with his mother."She updated me, saying that she had checked in her bags and was in the plane. We had been trying to call her mobile number but it is unreachable."We hope she will come home safely," he said.The other Indian nationals onboard MH370 are Chandrika Sharma, Chetna Kolekar, Vinod Kolekar and Swanand Kolekar.The Hindu reported on Sunday that Sharma, 51, the executive secretary of Chennai-based International Collective in Support of Fish Workers, was going to Mongolia from Beijing.An expert in the fisheries sector, she was heading to Ulaanbaatar for a regional conference organised by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation. She celebrates her birthday later this month.Chetna, 55, her husband Vinod, 59, and their son Swanand, 23, had traveled to Malaysia for a connecting flight to China, to meet their eldest son Sanved, who works in the Chinese capital.Sanved told The Hindu that he was waiting for his family to arrive at the airport in Beijing when he learned that all contact with the plane had been lost."I don't know what happened. They (the airlines) haven't given me any information," he said.MH370 left Kuala Lumpur International Airport for Beijing after midnight on Saturday, with 227 passengers of 14 nationalities and an all-Malaysian cabin crew.The fate of the plane and its passengers remains unknown as search and rescue operation enters its fourth day. – March 11, 2014.
