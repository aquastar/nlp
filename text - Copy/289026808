I can't think beyond another minute. I've got two young kids and I've got a three year old who's asking 'when is Daddy going to Skype?' He's got a map on his wall where Daddy plotted where his Dad is going to be and so he looks and says 'when is Dad going to Skype? Will Daddy be there? When will he Skype?' So, luckily he is with friends at the moment but I will cross that bridge when I have to cross that bridge if I have to."Australian and New Zealand Prime MInisters expressed their saddness for the families of passengers of the aircraft, which went missing about an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.[Tony Abbott, Australian Prime Minister]:"This is a terrible tragedy.

Of course the wait is most unbearable for the family members of those on the flight and our thoughts are with them."Malaysian King Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah also offered his condolences.He said he and the Queen would like to express their sympathy to the passengers and crew, especially to their families.
