Someone on board the missing Malaysian Airlines plane was already disabling the aircraft's tracking systems as the pilot made his last radio contact, officials believe.When Captain Zaharie Ahmed Shah said "all right, good night" as the aircraft left Malaysian-run air space on March 8, the plane's data communications system was switched off, Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said .Both the timing and informal nature of the phrase, spoken to air traffic controllers could further heighten suspicions of hijacking or sabotage on the plane, which was carrying 239 people when it vanished.The sign-off came after one of the plane's data communication systems, which would have enabled it to be tracked beyond radar coverage, had been deliberately switched off, said Mr Hussein."The answer to your question is yes, it was disabled before," he told reporters when asked if the ACARS system - a maintenance computer that sends back data on the plane's status - had been deactivated before the voice sign-off.The pilot's informal hand-off went against standard radio procedures, which would have called for him to read back instructions for contacting the next control center and include the aircraft's call sign, said Hugh Dibley, a former British Airways pilot and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.Investigators are likely to examine the recording for any signs of psychological stress and to determine his identity to confirm whether the flight deck had been taken over by hijackers or the pilot himself was involved, he said.Malaysian investigators are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on the missing plane for clues as to why someone on board flew it perhaps thousands of miles off course.Meanwhile, relatives of the 239 passengers and crew on board missing Flight MH370 are clinging to every shred of evidence their loved ones are still alive.Last night they were given a major boost after the authorities admitted for the first time the missing Malaysia Airlines jet may have landed rather than crashed.As the search, widened a senior official in Kuala Lumpur confirmed it was “possible” ­satellite signals from the plane could have been sent while it was on the ground.That sparked hopes it may have been flown to a remote spot by hijackers who at some point will outline their demands.But there were also fears for the safety of those on board after the FBI described the ­disappearance as “an act of piracy”.For all the latest on the disappearance of flight MH370 follow our live blog.
