In Malaya the Muslim community determines the outlook of the individuals but in Sabah it is the individuals that determine the community.Sabah and Sarawak has never been integrated on the economic front with the Federation of Malaya.Nearly 58% of the goods are imported from Malaya but due to the Cabotage Policy no foreign ships are allowed to enter directly into Sabah and Sarawak ports.All goods to Sabah and Sarawak must first be sent to Port Klang then it is put into feeder coastal ships and sent to Sabah and Sarawak.This  incurrs additional cost for goods to Kota Kinabalu and Kuching,  especially if it is imported products.Such logistical issues however do not arise in Malaya. Malaya is amply serviced by inter-connecting highways and railway systems.Here’s another imbalance. Malaya only imports 13% of goods from the Borneo states.  Needless to say how much more is imported by Borneo from Malaya. On trade alone there is such a significant imbalance.Fiscal and monetary policy is controlled and managed from Kuala Lumpur.Issues for the Borneo states include the cost of living. Cost of living is higher in Kuching and Kota Kinabalu than in Kuala Lumpur.When something cost RM1.00 in Kuala Lumpur, the same product may cost RM1.40 in Kuching or Kota Kinabalu.This means the cost of goods in the Borneo States is 30% – 50% higher than those in Malaya.A simple example is the difference of prices such as magazines, newspaper and periodicals.The Cabotage Policy cannot differentiate between Muslims and non-Muslims – the higher cost of living is equally imposed on the population.The population of Sabah is 3.2 million people, 65% of them are Muslims. How is it then that Umno, a Muslim party with Muslim leaders imposed Carbitage Policy in Sabah?Having said that lets look at the ‘Malay’ politics in Sabah.Muslims in Sabah and the Muslims in Malaya are not the same eventhough they are from the same SunnahWal Jemaah.What they learn may be the same but how the community practices this belief and their way of life may not be the same.In Malaya, the community determines the outlook of the individuals but in Sabah it is the individuals that determine the community.Umno may have spread its wings to Sabah but it is still not politically integrated.Umno in Sabah is just convenience and political expediency.Firstly, people in Sabah cannot be associated as Malay just because they are Muslims.The people in Sabah may be Muslim but they are equally proud to be Bajau, Irranun, Dusun, Murut, Brunei, Suluk and 40 other ethnic groups and sub-groups.Secondly, Umno as an institution holds no meaning to them. Umno is just a grouping they belong to and are detached from any sentiments.They can just easily throw away Umno like some old rag, unlike some of the Malays in Malaya. To them leaving Umno is considered“murtad”.Malaya did not understand these differences or similarities if there is any.  They have not made any attempt to understand these differences.Perhaps it is because the people from Malaya feel they are far superior to the people in the Borneo states.They still believe that when push comes to shove, they can always depend on the call for “Malay or Muslim brotherhood”.Unfortunately this call is an overused term, and hold no meaning to Muslims in Sabah.Zainnal Ajamain has held several senior positions in the civil service and government think tanks.
