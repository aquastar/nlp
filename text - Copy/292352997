Affected family members of missing flight MH370 have the choice of filing a suit not only in the two cities involved, but also in the country where the ticket was purchased, the home base of the airline (Malaysia, in this case) or the principal place of residence of the passenger. – The Malaysian Insider pic, April 7, 2014.Despite having only three American passengers on board the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, there is intense activity in the courts in the United States – with American law firms taking part in a "gold rush" to grab a share of the lucrative airline accident compensation for which their courts are known."Because US courts are the only venue where the settlement damages recognise the value of the passengers’ enduring companionship and lost income, it is always the preferred location to file a suit," reported a Minnesota-based local daily, Minnpost.A provision in the Montreal Convention, an international agreement signed by all countries to provide uniformity of rules for international carriage, including matters related to air crash compensation, gives families of victims several options to file their suits against an airline.In the case of MH370, which went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, the affected family members have the choice of filing a suit not only in the two cities involved, but also in the country where the ticket was purchased, the home base of the airline (Malaysia, in this case) or the principal place of residence of the passenger.The huge settlement awarded by American courts – with each suit likely fetching between US$8 (RM26.5 million) and US$10 million in settlement – makes American law firms the choice, and this explains the current "gold rush."To illustrate how aggressive American law firms are when it comes to filing compensation claims on behalf of family of passengers, Minnpost recalled how in the aftermath of the Northwest Airlines crash of 1987, one law firm sent its agent disguised as a priest to mingle with distraught relatives of passengers, before finally getting a copy of the flight manifest containing contact names of family members of passengers.The settlements in the suits involving the Northwest crash, one of the deadliest in US history, ranged from US$1 million to US$2 million per passenger, with attorneys earning an estimated 25% to 33% share, Minnpost reported.In the case of MH370, "Industry analysts estimate that a US-based suit can garner a US$8 million to US$10 million settlement. At the same time, the standard for negligence and liability is particularly narrow in most foreign countries."Minnpost said a CNN estimate that suits litigated in Malaysia or China could only fetch compensations of US$1 million per passenger.That is not to say that lucrative compensation is assured in US courts.The daily noted that in the Air France flight 447 crash of 2009, families involved had little success filing their suits in American courts, as judges dismissed them for not fulfilling one of the requirements for a suit to be filed there, as spelled out by the Montreal convention.Meanwhile, Ribbeck Law Chartered filed the first court action in connection with the missing MH370 but a Cook County judge threw out two petitions filed by the Chicago-based firm last week and threatened to impose sanctions against the firm if it again filed what the court described as improper, baseless motions. – April 7, 2014.
