A week after its disappearance, there is still no trace of flight MH370.During a press conference on Saturday, Malaysian prime minister confirmed that the plane had changed course due to "deliberate action", without openly saying hijacking was the cause."Up until the point at which it left military primary radar coverage, these movement are consistent with deliberate action of someone on the plane," he said.These new details bring search operations one step closer to finding the plane."The planeâ€™s last communication with the satellite was in one of two possible corridors. A northern corridor, stretching from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand. Or a southern corridor stretching approximately from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. The investigation team is working to further refine the information," he said.The plane took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:41 a.m. on March 8th. It was due to land in Beijing about 6 hours later.227 passengers and 12 crew from 14 nationalities were on board, with 153 of them Chinese.Contact with the plane was lost about an hour after take off, when it was believed to be flying over the Ho Chi Minh air traffic control area in Vietnam.Search and rescue started soon afterwards, with early reports of oil slicks later denied. Facing mounting questions, Malaysian officials said nothing was found in connection to the missing plane.On Wednesday, the search for the missing plane was expanded to an area stretching from China to India.On Thursday, Malaysian authorities denied reports that the plane flew for hours after its last contact.The following day, the search area was widened again to cover the Indian Ocean.
