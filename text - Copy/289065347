KUALA LUMPUR: The Department of Environment has slapped 119 people with compound fines while another 31 were issued with warning notices for carrying out open burning.Natural Resources and Environment Minister Datuk Seri G. Palanivel said this was just the start, and DOE will not hesitate to take those who flout the "total ban on open burning" directive issued on Monday, to court following the worsening haze situation in some parts of the country.He said DOE had, since Monday, identified 1,392 open burning activities, comprising 284 forest fires, agriculture (482), industries (18), construction sites (45), rubbish dumps (24), bushes (285) and small open fires (254).Today, Palanivel said 17 areas recorded good Air Pollutant Index, 32 moderate while three areas, namely Port Klang and Banting in Selangor and Bukit Rambai in Malacca unhealthy."Fifty-two stations around the country have been monitoring the air quality. The haze within the country is due to land and forest fires especially in Selangor, Perak, Pahang, Johor and Terengganu," he said, adding that the other causes were due to emission of smoke from industries, vehicles and land works.Palanivel said the present hot weather was due to the dry spell and haze.To avert further worsening of the situation, he said, DOE will enforce its Standard Operating Procedure of taking to task all those who carry out open burning as well as those whose vehicles emit smoke.Meanwhile, Director-General of Health Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said they would advise that schools be closed if the API reaches very unhealthy levels."We are also monitoring the situation," he said, adding that the public should refrain from all outdoor activities, if possible, to avoid falling ill.It is very important, Hisham advised, for the public to wear a face mask when outdoors, drink plenty of water and seek medical help if they suffer symptoms related to the haze such as breathing difficulties, runny nose, itchy eyes and skin irritation.
