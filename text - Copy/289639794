KUALA LUMPUR - The search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 spiralled into a litany of false news after it was determined that the plane did not land in Beijing.The B777-200 aircraft had left Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am and was scheduled to land in Beijing at 6.30am on March 8.As the search for the missing jetliner began in earnest, there was much confusion created by reports of debris seen floating in the South China Sea and also witness accounts of seeing fireballs falling from the sky in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.The authorities coordinating the search were forced to verify every report, with Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein repeatedly having to advise family members of passengers and crew on board the missing plane to stay calm and ignore speculation.
