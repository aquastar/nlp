SIBU: Relatives and friends are still clinging to hope that Andrew Nari — chief steward of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 — will come back to them.They gathered at his mother’s longhouse — Rumah Catherine Tamoh – on Monday to pray for a miracle.The Rejang Park Rosary Prayer Group led by Justin Balang joined the longhouse folk to pray for Andrew as well as the other crew members and passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.“The hope of Andrew coming back to us has become slimmer, so we have to go by prayers hoping that God’s power could provide a miracle,” said Andrew’s uncle Augustine Liom.“We are hanging to whatever slim hope that we have left. The aircraft has not been found. Our hopes are very slim, but where there is a chance, we still keep on to that hope,” he told reporters.He said the family members, especially Andrew’s mother, are having a hard time but managing to cope.“I think this is the first time that such a case has ever happened even in the whole world. We are very sad,” he said.He described Andrew as a good son, husband and father, who is loved by his family and the people who know him.“He has no ill-intention on anybody. He makes friends very easily. As for me, because his father had passed away, I played the role of a father to him, because he has no other uncle in the family here,” he said.Augustine said Andrew had lived with him in Kuching for three years when attending upper secondary school.He said Andrew would return to Sibu whenever he could, the last time being Christmas.Andrew’s family would attend Mass at St Mary’s of the Divine Mercy Church here and St Joseph’s Cathedral in Kuching.
