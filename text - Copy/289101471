Where did it go missing?Flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing departed at 12.41am on Saturday March 8. After that, what happened is not clear. Until Tuesday, the last known location was above the Gulf of Thailand, roughly 40 minutes into its journey.But now the Malaysian Air Force say its radars tracked the plane as it turned West and headed back across Malaysia and into the Strait of Malacca, where it was last detected at 30,000ft at 2.40am above the small island of Pulau Perak.There were 227 passengers from 14 countries, but the majority (153) were Chinese. There were 12 crew, all Malaysian.There were two men travelling on stolen passports, both Iranian, and suspected illegal immigrants.Do we have any idea what happened?No. The authorities are considering mechanical failure, hijacking, sabotage, any psychological problems among passengers and crew and any personal problems among the passengers and crew. But, as Malaysia's Civil Aviation chief said, until a fragment of the plane is recovered, a piece of hard evidence which can be analysed, no conclusions can be drawn.How big is the search operation?It is getting bigger every day, but at least 10 countries have sent dozens of ships and aircraft to comb both the Gulf of Thailand, the Malacca Strait, and most of northern Malaysia.Has any debris been found?No. There have been several false leads, but no debris or oil slick connected to the plane has been found. Experts point out that the plane should have left an oil slick if it hit the water, and that parts of it would float, unless the entire aeroplane landed on the water intact and then sank.
