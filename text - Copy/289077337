Malaysian police say one of two suspect passengers who flew on a missing passenger jet was an Iranian illegal immigrant, as relatives of some of the 239 people on board say their hopes for a miracle are ebbing away.Authorities have doubled the search radius to 100 nautical miles (equivalent to 185 kilometres) around the point where Malaysia Airlines MH370 disappeared from radar over the South China Sea early Saturday, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing."We are intensifying our search and rescue, and hoping against hope there is still an opportunity for us to rescue (the passengers and crew)," Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters.The parliament of Muslim-majority Malaysia observed a moment of silence and prayer for the 227 passengers and 12 crew.The 34-year-old son of Malaysian security guard Subramaniam Gurusamy was on the flight to do business in Beijing for an oil company."My three-year-old grandson is asking: 'where is Dad?' We tell him father has gone to buy sweets for you," Gurusamy, 60, said as he broke down in tears."Please bring back my son. I am praying for divine intervention. That is the only hope we have."Fears of terrorism were stoked by the weekend revelation that two men boarded the flight using stolen European passports. But police said people-smuggling was emerging as the likeliest explanation for the identity fraud.One of the pair had been identified as 19-year-old Iranian Pouria Nourmohammadi Mehrdad, Malaysia's national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters."We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terror group and we believe he was trying to migrate to Germany," he said, adding that authorities had not yet identified the other man.Khalid said police were not ruling anything out, focusing their investigations on various theories including a hijacking, sabotage or psychological problems among passengers or crew.The two passports - one Italian and one Austrian - were stolen over the past two years in Thailand, where police have long been battling a thriving trade in Western documents used by criminal gangs.An Iranian man identified as "Mr Ali" made the two bookings by phone through a travel agency in the Thai resort of Pattaya on March 1, asking for the two cheapest tickets to Europe, Thai police say."We believe that these two passports were stolen by a human-smuggling gang who send people to work in third countries, especially European countries," Lieutenant General Panya Maman, commander of Thailand's southern police region, told AFP.One of the tickets was from Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt, via Beijing and Amsterdam, while the final destination for the other ticket was Copenhagen, according to travel documents seen by AFP.Flight MH370, captained by a veteran MAS pilot, had relayed no indications of distress, and weather at the time was said to be good.The vastness of the search zone reflects authorities' bafflement over the plane's disappearance. On the fourth day of searching, the operation had grown to involve 42 ships and 35 aircraft from Southeast Asian countries, Australia, China, New Zealand and the United States.Vietnam asked fishing boats off its southern coast - where the flight dropped off radar - for help in the effort but said it feared the worst."In terms of our assessments and predictions - we have little hope of a positive outcome," Pham Quy Tieu, deputy minister of transport, said Tuesday.Conflicting information has deepened the anguish of relatives, with tests on oil slicks in the South China Sea showing they were not from the missing jet and reports of possible debris from the flight also proving to be false alarms.
