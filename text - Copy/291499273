The search for the missing plane continues[GETTY]Yesterday it emerged MI6, the UK’s foreign intelligence agency, is assisting Malaysian investigators to discover why flight MH370 vanished from the skies.The CIA and Chinese intelligence services are also analysing possible leads.The revelation came as a massive search of a new target zone by an international task force continued, with a naval vessel equipped with a US Navy black box detector and an unmanned submarine leading the hunt.Malaysia’s acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein revealed that British agents had joined the probe.MI6 is understood to have helped with extensive background checks on the 239 passengers and crew on board the Boeing 777.Mr Hishammuddin said MI6 was also examining “pings” emitted by the plane that were used to plot its route for seven hours after its communications systems were disabled.He said: “Now that we are talking about satellite data and imagery, the CIA has been on board, Chinese intelligence has been on board, MI6 has been on board.”Investigators believe the disappearance of the plane and the decision to disable the communications system appear to have been deliberate.The aircraft turned wildly off course shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to ­Beijing.It is thought the plane flew south over the Indian Ocean before running out of fuel and crashing into the sea.
