Malaysia has expanded its search area for its missing plane on the East Sea after three days of scouring the sea failed to bring forth any confirmed sightings of any piece of wreckage, an official said on March 10.   Chief of the Malaysian Civil Aviation Department Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said apart from the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam, authorities were also searching on land in the country and in its western waters.   Meanwhile, China has adjusted up to 10-resolution satellites to locate the missing plane, the People’s Liberation Army has said.   According to China’s Ministry of Public Security, there were only two passengers using stolen passports to board the Boeing 777-200.   Representatives of Chinese insurance companies said they are willing to compensate families of the passengers, adding that the compensations will be refunded within 24 hours since the incident is officially identified.   The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 that lost contact with authorities on its route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 had 239 people aboard, including 12 crew members. Nearly two-thirds of those on board were Chinese. The rest hail from 14 other nations, such as Canada, New Zealand, the United States and Ukraine.-VNA
