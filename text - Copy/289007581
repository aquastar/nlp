KUALA LUMPUR: Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Shabery Cheek yesterday expressed disappointment and sadness over the attitude of people who made fun of the incident of the missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight.“It is most saddening. When a tragedy occurs, the people should come together. We cannot make fun. It is easy for some people to say that anything associated with or stated by the government is untrue,” he said.Ahmad Shabery was speaking to reporters at the lobby of Parliament House after today’s sitting of the Dewan Rakyat.He was commenting on those people who continued to make fun of the incident on the social media, making irresponsible statements which pitted the people against one another.Ahmad Shabery said the people must understand that the disappearance of the MAS aircraft was something out of the ordinary and which required expertise to unravel.“If we watch the Air Crash Investigation series, accidents involving flights occur for a variety of reasons, various factors … all of these cannot be easily unravelled,” he said.Asked what action the ministry was contemplating against those people who made fun of the incident, Ahmad Shabery said the focus of the ministry now was on efforts to locate the aircraft.“Right now, our priority is to unlock the mystery of the missing aircraft … let’s try and solve that first,” he said. — Bernama
