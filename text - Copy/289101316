The mother of a Queensland man who was onboard a Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared has spoken of her heartache.Rodney and Mary Burrows were on their way to China for a holiday to celebrate their retirement.Rodney's mother Irene Burrows says the family has been left devastated."How can a plane just disappear?"This happens to other people, not to people of the likes of us who has a son and daughter-in-law on this plane who wouldn't hurt or harm anybody and were just a loving couple."She described her son as 'happy-go-lucky.'"I spoke to him a couple of days before (they left) and he was very excited about going, it's not their first overseas trip but it had been planned for a long time," she said.The couple have three adult children and Mrs Burrows says it's a very difficult time for them."It's terrible to talk to them because they're just absolutely devastated," she said."Carla is expecting a baby in a month's time, their first grandchild was arriving so they're pretty devastated."She said the family doesn't plan to travel to Malaysia."Not unless something is found," she said."Malaysia Airlines have offered them flights anytime they wanted but at this stage no one has attempted to do anything, why would you want to go there when there's nothing."Mrs Burrows says the family is no longer holding out hope for their return."Now we think they're gone because it's too late now, too long," she said."I'm sure something terrible has happened."Mrs Burrows says she and her husband will travel from Biloela to Brisbane to be with family."We've decided to go down, the grandkids down there want to see grandma and grandad," she said.A massive search operation is yet to locate the aircraft.
