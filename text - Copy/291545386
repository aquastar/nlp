The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 could take years, a senior US Navy official has said, as search and rescue officials raced to locate the plane's black box recorder days before its batteries are set to die.Ten ships and as many aircraft are searching a massive area in the Indian Ocean west of Perth, trying to find some trace of the aircraft, which went missing more than three weeks ago and is presumed to have crashed.The Malaysian government announced moves to tighten airport security, but the head of the US senate intelligence committee said there was no evidence that terrorism had any role to play in the flight's disappearance."There's speculation, but there's nothing," said Sen Dianne Feinstein. "This is a very difficult mission."Among the vessels to join the search is an Australian defence force ship, the Ocean Shield, that has been fitted with a sophisticated US black box locator and an underwater drone.Captain Mark Matthews, a United States navy officer who is in charge of the black box pinger detector, said the search area - which covers 123,000 square miles, about the size of Poland - needs to be significantly reduced before there is any serious prospect of finding the black box."It is critical that we find that surface debris so we can reduce the area that we'd need to conduct an underwater search in," he said."Right now the search area is basically the size of the Indian Ocean, which would take an untenable amount of time to search."Another US navy official, Commander William Marks, told CBS News: "You have to wonder if the debris is even out there."Echoing that assessment, Todd Curtis, an aviation expert and former Boeing engineer, warned the hunt for the plane could turn into a "Titanic"-style quest that could last for years.He said the black box was unlikely to be found before its 30-day pinger - which helps searchers locate both the box and the plane - runs out of battery life in about a week."The likelihood of finding the plane quickly, especially given the pinger will soon end, is going down astronomically," he told The Daily Telegraph."Even if they found the debris today, there is the problem of estimating where it drifted over the past three weeks and then estimating the new area. It all has the potential to take much more than two years."Dr Curtis said the search was likely to be "very prolonged" and may end in failure, at least in the short term."There is a chance they will never find the plane," he said. "If it is not found, it will turn into a Titanic-type search - something that won't be forgotten by either the general public or the countries involved."The failure to find any wreckage from the plane has been harrowing for families of the 239 passengers, many of whom continue to cling to hope of survivors.Twenty-nine distraught Chinese family members flew to Malaysia yesterday, demanding the authorities "reveal the truth" and "hand over the murderer".At an emotive press conference, the grief-stricken relatives demanded answers from the Malaysian government. "We want the evidence, we want the truth, we want our families back," they chanted.The Malaysian government will introduce background screening for all passengers from June following the revelation that two Iranians aboard MH370 were travelling on false passports and that authorities lacked the technology to check passengers against Interpol's database of 40 million lost passports.The Iranian passengers have been cleared of suspicion."Our system is not capable for the time being," said Sakib Kusmi, a Malaysian immigration official.Malaysia Airlines has also moved to tighten security and safety and has put all flights and staff on "code tango", its highest level of alertness.
