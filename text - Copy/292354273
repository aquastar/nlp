But the Australian team leading the international search has warned there is no confirmed link to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.According to China’s Xinhua News Agency, the ship, Haixum 01, detected a signal with a frequency of 37.5 kilohertz per second. It was reported the sounds were heard for about 90 seconds.The reported discovery comes as the batteries powering the black box from the plane are expected to expire as early as Monday.The Chief Coordinator of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston (Ret’d), said Australian authorities were seeking more information from the Chinese side and were considering deploying air assets to the detection area.Today’s search will resume in three separate areas about 2000km northwest of Perth, totalling 216,000 square kilometres.Up to 10 military planes, 2 civil planes and 13 ships will join the search.False hopes, including sightings of suspected debris that turned out to be random flotsam, have repeatedly punctuated the search for the missing plane, keeping the anguished families of the 239 people aboard on an emotional roller-coaster.“This is not the first time we have had something that has turned out to be very disappointing,” Australian Defence Minister David Johnston said on ABC television.Malaysian authorities also said they were seeking to verify the report before commenting.Search teams from eight nations, including Australian and British ships with special detection equipment, are racing against time to find the black box and its vital flight data before the signal fades.The Haixun 01 picked up the pulse signal at about 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude - about 1500km northwest of Perth.The president of pinger manufacturer Dukane Seacom has confirmed that this is the “standard beacon frequency” of both black boxes on MH370 — the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.Xinhua also reported that a Chinese air force plane had spotted a number of white floating objects in the search area.Commercial jets are equipped with two black boxes — the Cockpit Voice Recorder and the Flight Data Recorder — that transmit acoustic signals on a beacon frequency of 37.5 kHz.These sounds, or pulses, cannot be heard with human ears. Australia’s Ocean Shield is towing a pinger locator listening for sounds at this frequency, and the British ship HMS Echo had a hull-mounted device capable of detecting the same pulses.Haixun 01 picked up the signal at about 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, the official Xinhua news agency said. The location appears to be far to the west of the current search locationShanghai-based Xinmin Evening News cited its reporter on board the patrol ship as reporting that the ship’s crew had “basically confirmed” that the signal was from the missing Boeing 777-200.However, experts have cautioned that the same signal could come from “a variety of things”.“It could be a false signal,” oceanographer Simon Boxall told CNN. “We’ve had a lot of red herrings, hyperbole on this whole search.”The media office of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre said the could not say anything about the signal or whether it had come from MH370.“We are unable to verify any such information at this point in time,” the office said.According to the Royal Australian Navy’s mission commander on the Ocean Shield, James Lybrand, it would be expected that if a boat passed over the black box, the sound would quickly fade as the ship moved away.It would then be required to turn back over the search area and “localise” the frequency emissions, which could take hours.Commander Lybrand said yesterday there was “negligible” chance any pings at 37.5kHz was from biological sources, such as whales, and would almost certainly be from one of the two black boxes.“We can’t verify this information at this point in time,” said a spokesman for Joint Australian Coordination Centre.The Chief Coordinator of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston (Ret’d), said reports that the Chinese ship, Haixun 01, had detected electronic pulse signals in the Indian Ocean related to MH370 could not be verified at this point in time.“I have been advised that a series of sounds have been detected by a Chinese ship in the search area. The characteristics reported are consistent with the aircraft black box. A number of white objects were also sighted on the surface about 90 kilometres from the detection area. However, there is no confirmation at this stage that the signals and the objects are related to the missing aircraft,” Air Chief Marshal Houston said.“Advice tonight from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is that they cannot verify any connection to the missing aircraft.“The RCC in Australia has spoken to the RCC in China and asked for any further information that may be relevant.“The deployment of RAAF assets to the area where the Chinese ship detected the sounds is being considered.“I will provide further updates if, and when, more information becomes available.”It has been nearly a month since Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared en route to Beijing on March 8 with 239 people on board.Up to 10 military planes, three civilian jets and 11 ships are scouring a 217,000-sq-km patch of ocean northwest of Perth near where investigators believe the plane went down on March 8.Australian Defence Minister David Johnston was asked about the matter during a live cross on ABC24 for the WA Senate election.“I know nothing. I don’t want to confirm anything because I think there has been a lot of this sort of false positives,” Senator Johnston said.“Let’s wait until we have an official release.“But look, I’m excited, I’m optimistic, but let me tell you it’s a very, very big ocean out there and up until this time, we’ve had a lot of disappointment.”Senator Johnston said he had not had a chance to “get to the bottom of this” as he had been busy with the election, but stressed there had been “a huge probability of false positives” in relation to the missing Malaysian Airlines flight.“Let’s just stay calm,” he said.He said he would await information from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.
