The Navy said Tuesday that a second San Diego-based warship is involved in the search for the lost Malaysia Airlines flight.The destroyer Kidd was one of the first responders in the hunt for the Boeing 777 that went missing Saturday.“The ambiguity of the potential crash site makes the area to be searched expansive, but the two MH-60R helicopters deployed on Kidd provide a much improved search capability than ships alone,” a press release from the Navy’s Task Force 70 said.Another San Diego destroyer, the Pinckney, is also involved in the search. Both ships left San Diego on Jan. 7 for independent deployments to the Asia region."The entire USS KIDD crew is dedicated to this operation," said Cmdr. Gabe Varela, Kidd's commanding officer, in a Navy release Tuesday."If our families were on that flight, we would hope others would do the same. It is just fortunate we were already operating in the South China Sea, allowing us to get on station in a timely manner."The Malaysia Airlines plane took off from Kuala Lumpur early Saturday en route to Beijing before going mysteriously missing with 239 people aboard.
