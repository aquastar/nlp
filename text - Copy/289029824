Malaysia Airlines has slammed rumors circulating about its missing MH370 flight.One false story is that five passengers checked in for the flight but failed to board the aircraft, and their luggage which had been checked in had not been removed from the aircraft. "The claim is untrue," the airline said in a statement Tuesday."Malaysia Airlines wishes to clarify that there were four passengers who had valid booking to travel on flight MH370, 8 March 2014, but did not show up to check-in for the flight," the airline's statement said."As such, the issue of off-loading unaccompanied baggage did not arise, as the said four passengers did not check in for the flight. Hence, the above claim is untrue."The airline has also criticised allegations being made against the flight's First Officer, Fariq Ab Hamid. The airline said it was taking the claims "very seriously." It emerged on Tuesday that Hamid had invited two female passengers into the cockpit on a previous one-hour flight. He and his co-pilot were photographed with the passengers and these photographs and a video were posted on the Internet Tuesday. It is a breach of security for passengers to enter the cockpit."We are shocked by these allegations," the airline said Tuesday."We have not been able to confirm the validity of the pictures and videos of the alleged incident."The airline said it did not need distractions of this nature, which were diverting their attention away from their prime focus of finding the missing plane."As you are aware, we are in the midst of a crisis, and we do not want our attention to be diverted," the airline statement said."We also urge the media and general public to respect the privacy of the families of our colleagues and passengers. It has been a difficult time for them."
