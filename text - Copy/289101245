Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail speaks to The Malaysian Insider in Kajang. She was named the PKR candidate for the state constituency which goes the polls on March 23. – The Malaysian Insider pic by Nazir Sufari, March 11, 2014.Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's conviction and disqualification from contesting in the Kajang by-election is expected to boost support from Malays, said PKR president who is also the party's candidate, Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail.She said the response from Malays had perceptibly changed towards PR after the Court of Appeal overturned Anwar's acquittal on the second sodomy charge."Maybe before, when we were conducting visits, there was a perception that they (Malays) were not too enthusiastic."But after the judgment, there is a clear picture that many felt it was unjust and they are going to throw their support behind us."There is this feeling that Anwar has been victimised again," Dr Wan Azizah said in an interview today with The Malaysian Insider at the PKR operations centre in Sungai Sekamat, Kajang. Dr Wan Azizah will be facing MCA's Datin Paduka Chew Mei Fun, the Barisan Nasional candidate, in the March 23 polls.Although Pakatan is set to retain Kajang, an increase in Malay votes would drive up its winning majority and help deal with its weak image among Malays.However, Dr Wan Azizah refuted suggestions that she was contesting in Kajang in order to get sympathy votes.This is not the first time she is standing in for her husband, having contested for Permatang Pauh parliamentary seat when her husband was jailed 1998. She remained the Permatang Pauh MP for nine years before resigning in 2008 to make way for Anwar to return to active politics. She has been the PKR president since the formation of Parti Keadilan Nasional, later renamed Parti Keadilan Rakyat following a merger with Parti Rakyat Malaysia."This is not about getting sympathy. I felt called upon to this because the injustice in the courts was very clear and we need to change it."PR has accused Umno of wanting to disqualify Anwar from contesting in Kajang, to prevent the opposition leader from becoming the Selangor Menteri Besar.In January, PKR's Kajang assemblyman resigned to pave the way for Anwar to enter the Selangor state assembly, in a move dubbed the "Kajang plan" which will see Tan Sri Abdul Khalid Ibrahim replaced as the MB.Dr Wan Azizah was non-committal on whether she would also be slated to enter the Selangor administration."I will be part of the state legislature. We want to work with Khalid to improve the performance of the state government," she said, when asked repeatedly if she would join Khalid's administration. – March 11, 2014.
