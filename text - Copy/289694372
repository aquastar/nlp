NEW DELHI: Air traffic controllers in Kolkata have ruled out the possibility that the missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 plane flew through Indian airspace without being detected."If an aircraft wants to avoid being seen, they can easily become invisible to civilian radar by switching off the transponder. But it cannot avoid defence systems," said Kolkata air traffic controllers' guild secretary Sugata Pramanik, in an interview with The Times of India."The IAF (Indian Air Force) has radars in multiple installations across the country and it is inconceivable that none of them spotted the odd blip with no flight clearance," he said.Speaking to the English daily in Kolkata, Sugata had said that while Flight MH370 could have avoided detection on the Secondary Surveillance Radar, the blip by the huge Boeing 777-200ER aircraft would surely have been spotted by the Indian Air Force (IAF), which uses Primary Surveillance Radars to detect such intrusions.There are nine Air Defence Identification zones in the country that are manned round-the-clock to prevent an enemy aircraft from violating Indian airspace, said the report.Kolkata Airport has an Automatic Dependence Surveillance Radar and Controller-Pilot Datalink Communication that enables it to not only trail planes when it is in the radar zone of 60 nautical miles or nearly 120km and beyond through very high frequency radio, but also through the data link when the plane goes out of voice communication range.However, there are large areas in the Kolkata Flight Information Region, particularly over the Bay of Bengal, that have no radar coverage at present.A radar has been installed in Andaman and Nicobar Islands but is yet to be commissioned, said the daily.Sugata was commenting on the possibility that the plane flew through Indian airspace, one of the two 'corridors' that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak suggested at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.The other corridorÂ of the flight - whose communication system is now believed to have been deliberately disabled - is to the Indian Ocean south of the Straits of Malacca where the plane was last sighted on Malaysian military radar. - Bernama
