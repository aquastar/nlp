Two relatives of a Filipina worker who was abducted from a floating resort in Sabah last Wednesday have been detained by Sabah authorities.Sabah police commissioner Datuk Hamza Taib said two of four people detained so far are kin of Marcy Dayawan, Malaysia's The Star Online reported.However, Hamza declined to reveal how they were related to Dayawan, who was abducted along with Chinese tourist Gao Huayun, 29.At least four resort workers, a man and three women, have been detained so far in connection with the abduction. At least 15 other resort workers were detained for lacking valid travel documents.Philippine and Sabah authorities suspect the Abu Sayyaf bandit group may be behind the abduction.Sabah authorities are also verifying information that the Abu Sayyaf gunmen slipped into Semporna and blended in with the local Filipino community for at least a week before the abduction.The Star Online report added the Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) also believes the gunmen had “inside help” getting to the resort.Esscom director-general Datuk Mohammad Mentek said they are checking how the seven gunmen bypassed tight security in Semporna to reach the resort.Mohammad said their investigation so far indicated the gunmen might have links with some of the resort workers.“There is a specific route to the resort and you must know the area for you to go in. If they had taken a wrong turn they would have been caught in fishing nets. They needed to be guided into the resort personally,” he said.
