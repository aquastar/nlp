Perth:Â Four weeks into the hunt for MH370, pressure is building for better ways of tracking aircraft as regulators wrestle with the Malaysian jet's disappearance armed with only minimal information on the fate of its 227 passengers.As search efforts intensified on Saturday, four weeks after the Boeing went missing, a US pilots association called for existing satellite technology to be made mandatory so controllers can track jets.Until recently, aircraft flying over oceans well outside the reach of air traffic control routinely gave their position through high-frequency radio links that are vulnerable to interference from the atmosphere.Some airlines now use satellite-based voice and text communications, but these are not mandatory and may require a subscription that Malaysia Airlines had not signed up for, according to officials investigating the loss of Flight MH370."Technology that exists today can pinpoint the location of aircraft in near real time and, in this day and age, it is unacceptable that the location of the aircraft is unknown," the US-based Air Line Pilots Association said."Implementation of technology such as ADS-B and use of satellite surveillance of aircraft during flight operations must become the standard across the industry," it added in a statement received on Saturday.ADS-B is a satellite navigation device capable of linking to the Global Positioning System or other space-based networks.MH370 disappeared while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in the early hours of March 8.Authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems but say evidence suggests it was deliberately diverted and crashed in the Indian Ocean, where an intensive search is trying to find the plane's black box recorders before their batteries run out.Black boxes come with locator beacons designed to work for 30 days. A Chinese ship detected a signal in the south Indian Ocean on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua reported, but it was not immediately clear whether it came from the missing jet. (Planes, ships deployed to investigate Chinese signal)French authorities recommended extending the life of the batteries on the locating devices to 90 days after the crash of an Air France jet in the Atlantic in 2009, but the move will not become mandatory until 2018 or 2019.France's final report on the AF447 crash led to a rethink of how technology can help investigators track the wreckage, but aviation experts say changes can take years to negotiate.Experts say the jet's disappearance has renewed pressure for better use of tracking technology. Further recommendations may, however, have to wait for the jet's recorders to be found.After the Air France crash, a United Nations agency began looking at three reforms, but not all would be required by law.Under one of these, a jetliner would automatically beam back regular updates on its location throughout the flight. Under the second proposal, the jet would automatically send out useful tracking data when it senses it is about to crash.A third idea calls for the black box to be ejected from the aircraft just before impact, avoiding the risk of destruction.IFALPA, an association representing pilots globally, says better tracking would come about automatically through efforts already under way to overhaul air traffic by using satellites, but such schemes have been held up in part by budget problems.One US government official said the sheer scope of the international search effort, the frustration of not finding any sign of wreckage, and the lingering questions about whether there was a technical issue with the plane that caused the course change, could push the issue to a tipping point."I think it's different this time," said the official, asking not to be named. "People have been calling for this for years, but maybe now there's enough momentum to make it happen."But some in the aviation industry remain sceptical, citing inertia over changes in regulations in the past and the astonishingly rare disappearance, albeit with many casualties.The Flight Safety Foundation, a Washington-based non-governmental group campaigning on safety matters, has called for an international symposium to help improve flight tracking.Meanwhile Australia on Sunday sent planes and ships to investigate signals detected by a Chinese ship in the hunt for a missing Malaysian jet, saying they matched black box beacons and were an "important and encouraging lead".Angus Houston, the Australian head of the mission, said a second "ping" was also being scrutinised 300 nautical miles away in the Indian Ocean, as the one-month lifespan of batteries powering the beacons loomed.He said China's Haixun 01 has twice detected an underwater signal on a frequency used for flight data and cockpit voice recorders - once for 90 seconds on Saturday and another more fleeting "ping" on Friday a short distance away. (Chinese ship detects underwater ping in search for Malaysian jet)"This is an important and encouraging lead but one which I urge you to continue to treat carefully, we are working in a very big ocean and within a very large search area," Houston told reporters."Speculation and unconfirmed reports can see the loved ones of the passengers put through terrible stress and I don't want to put them under any further emotional distress at this very difficult time."Britain's HMS Echo and the Australian ship Ocean Shield - both also equipped with black box locators - and Australian air force planes were being diverted to the area to help discount or confirm the signals, Houston said.Ocean Shield was also investigating a signal it detected on Sunday in its current location, about 300 nautical miles north of Haixun 01, in waters far off Australia's west coast.Houston said the mission was taking both detections "very seriously" as time ticked down on the beacons' battery life, though he described the Chinese finding as the most promising."I think the fact that we've had two detections, two acoustic events in that location, provides some promise which requires a full investigation," he said.The hunt for the jet, which vanished on a flight between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing on March 8, was refocused on the southern end of the search zone Sunday after corrected satellite data showed it was more likely the plane entered the water there.Houston said the Haixun 01 was already operating in that more southerly zone.Some analysts greeted the acoustic detections with optimism, saying a 37.5kHz signal can only be transmitted by an emergency beacon. But others were sceptical and said it was vital to find supporting evidence.Houston said Haixun 01 was in waters about 4.5 kilometres (nearly three miles) deep, meaning "any recovery operation is going to be incredibly challenging and very demanding and will take a long period of time" if the plane is found there.The Malaysia Airlines mystery has been compared with Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic in 2009. Debris was located within a week but it took two years for undersea drones to recover the black box.Houston said that time was critical."This is day 30 of the search and the advertised time for the life of the batteries in the beacon is 30 days. Sometimes they last for several days beyond that - say eight to 10 days beyond that - but we're running out of time in terms of the battery life of the emergency locator beacons."Up to 10 military planes, two civil aircraft and 13 ships were scouring the remote waters on Sunday, concentrating on about 216,000 square kilometres of the Indian Ocean around 2,000 kilometres northwest of Perth.Houston insisted that China was "sharing everything that's relevant to this search" with the lead authority and sidestepped questions over the Haixun 01's location far from the other lead vessels in the search."China has seven ships out there, that's by far the largest fleet of ships out there. I think we should be focusing on the positives," he said.Anish Patel, president of US black box beacon manufacturer Dukane Seacom, has said he is "highly sceptical" about the Chinese report in the absence of any supporting evidence."Let's get some additional assets in the water so we can corroborate, before we get everyone's hopes up. Before we disappoint these families one more time I think we need to corroborate," he told CNN Saturday.But Charitha Pattiaratchi, a professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia, said the news was exciting."The 35.7 kHz is a man-made noise. There's not another noise at that frequency," he told AFP. "A whale or a dolphin or rain or an underwater earthquake... they have a completely different frequency."Malaysian authorities believe satellite readings indicate MH370 crashed in the Indian Ocean after veering dramatically off course for reasons that remain unknown.A criminal probe has focused on the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or psychological problems among passengers or crew, but there is no evidence yet to support any of the theories.
