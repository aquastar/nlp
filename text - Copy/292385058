Hopes were raised once more in the search for Malaysia's missing plane Saturday, after a Chinese ship said it had detected a "pulse signal" in the Indian Ocean, though authorities warned there was no evidence it was linked to MH370.Here is a timeline of major developments in the four-week hunt for the Boeing 777:-- Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 takes off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:41 am, bound for Beijing. It vanishes from Malaysian civilian radar at 1:30 am, just before passing to Vietnamese air traffic control. It blips on military radars until 2:15 am, but that sighting is only later identified as flight MH370.-- Vietnam launches a search operation that expands into a multinational hunt in the South China Sea.-- Vietnamese planes spot two oil slicks near the plane's last known location, but they turn out to be a false alarm -- the first of many.-- It emerges that two passengers were travelling on stolen EU passports, fuelling speculation of a terrorist attack. The two Iranian men are later revealed as suspected illegal immigrants.-- Malaysia's air force chief says the plane may have turned back towards Kuala Lumpur for no apparent reason, citing radar data.-- The search area now includes land on the Malaysian peninsula, the waters off its west coast, and an area to the north of Indonesia's Sumatra island -- all far from the flight's scheduled route.-- Malaysia expands the search zone again to include the Malacca Strait off its west coast and the Andaman Sea north of Indonesia.-- Malaysia's air force chief says an unidentified object was detected on military radar north of the Malacca Strait early Saturday, but says it is still being investigated.-- Chinese satellite images of suspected debris in the South China Sea are found to be yet another false lead.-- The hunt spreads to the Indian Ocean after the White House cites "new information" that the jet may have flown on after losing contact.-- At a dramatic news conference, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announces that the plane appears to have been flown deliberately for hours, veering sharply off-route at roughly the same time that its communications system and transponder were manually switched off.-- Satellite data now places the jet anywhere in one of two huge corridors of land and sea, stretching north into Central Asia and south into the Indian Ocean. The search in the South China Sea is called off.-- As the number of countries involved in the search jumps to 26, suspicions focus on the pilot and co-pilot, with experts examining a flight simulator installed in the home of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah.-- Officials say the relaxed-sounding last words from the cockpit -- initially reported to be "All right, good night" -- came two minutes before the plane's transponder was shut down.-- Malaysia Airlines says the voice is believed to be that of co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. Police also probe a potential political motive on the part of Captain Zaharie, a supporter and distant relative of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who denounces such talk.-- Australian and US surveillance planes begin combing 600,000 square kilometres (230,000 square miles) of the remote Indian Ocean in the southern search corridor.-- Desperate relatives of the 153 Chinese passengers threaten to go on hunger strike, insisting they are not being given the full truth.-- Malaysia says background checks on almost on board have produced nothing significant.-- With the 26-country search apparently bogged down in coordination problems, Thailand's air force reveals its military radar had picked up what appeared to be flight MH370 just minutes after it was diverted.-- Australia says satellites have spotted two objects, one estimated at 24 metres (79 feet) long, in a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean. A ship and aircraft are dispatched to the area, but spot nothing.-- Malaysia asks the US to provide undersea surveillance technology.-- China releases a new satellite photo of an object floating 120 kilometres from those pictured in the Australian images.-- Along with French satellite data indicating floating objects in the area, sightings of other debris raise hopes of a breakthrough.-- China and Australia both announce fresh, separate sightings of objects in the sea, adding to the mounting evidence of debris in the Indian Ocean.-- The US Navy orders a specialised black box locator sent to the area.-- Late in the evening, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announces "with deep sadness and regret" that MH370 is presumed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean, citing new analysis of satellite data. In a message to families, the airline states "we have to assume" the plane was lost at sea.-- Weather halts the search operation in the Indian Ocean.-- In Beijing, emotional Chinese relatives scuffle with guards outside Malaysia's Beijing embassy, demanding answers.-- The search resumes, buoyed by a fresh satellite sighting of potential debris by European aerospace giant Airbus.-- A US law firm launches the first legal salvo on behalf of grieving families, seeking millions of dollars per passenger.-- Weather grounds the search again, but Thailand and Japan report fresh sightings of floating debris.-- A Japanese government official says objects spotted by its satellite are "very probably" from the plane.-- Australia announces that the search area has shifted 1,100 kilometres northeast after a "credible new lead" from radar data that the plane was flying faster than first thought.-- The weather clears, sending ships and aircraft from six countries -- Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States -- racing to the new search area.-- Malaysia's transport minister says no matter how remote the odds, everything will be done to find "possible survivors".-- Australia appoints former military chief Angus Houston to head up a new unit to coordinate the operation in the Indian Ocean.-- Malaysia corrects the last reported words from one of the pilots in the cockpit, with the civil aviation department saying they were "Good night Malaysian three seven zero", and not the more casual "All right, good night" originally reported.-- All evidence points to MH370 being lost in the remote Indian Ocean, says Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.-- Malaysia's government reveals the full radio communications with the pilots of its missing flight, shedding little light on the mystery, but adding it would compile "false" media reports over the crisis and consider filing lawsuits.-- An Australian vessel equipped with a US-supplied "black box" detector nears the search area in the Indian Ocean, as Australia's search chief warns the box's signal is soon set to expire.-- Anwar Ibrahim says he believes Malaysia is concealing information on the plane's fate.-- A Chinese ship says it has detected a "pulse signal" at a frequency used by aircraft black boxes in the southern Indian Ocean, but authorities warn there is no evidence yet it is linked to the missing plane.
