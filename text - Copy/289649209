Defence Minister David Johnston has flagged a possible increase to Australia's contribution to the search for the missing flight MH370.Asked whether the federal government would step up its contribution should it emerge the flight veered close to Australian territory, Senator Johnston said: ''I know the Prime Minister would want to do that. And I think that's very clear. Malaysia's a good friend of Australia's and we would want to assist them in whatever way we conceivably could.''So far, Australia has contributed two RAAF P-3 Orion surveillance planes to the search, one of which was sent at the weekend to cover the Indian Ocean to the north and west of the Cocos Islands.Senator Johnston said the P-3 Orion was ''one of the most highly developed and mature maritime surveillance platforms in the world'' and therefore the best help Australia could give at the moment.''We're ... going to do whatever we can to assist the Malaysians, but of course we need as much information as we can; we can't just fly out into the middle of the Indian Ocean, so we're watching, monitoring and doing all the things that we can do to try and find more information to assist the Malaysians.''All I can say to the families is, we're doing our best. Bear with us.''Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he would be speaking with Malaysia later on Monday to ask what additional assistance Australia could offer to the investigation
