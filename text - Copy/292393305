At a meeting in Hawaii last week, the host country made an interesting offer to Asean. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel was critical about disaster planning and preparation in our region. And well he might be. The United States was trying to rally the Asian region to give a better response to global warming. The poor response to last monthâ€™s disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 is a good example of why action is needed.It is disturbing that a month after MH370 disappeared, crucial facts remain unknown. But it is frightening that this has occurred as a matter of policy of several Asean governments.Malaysia is rightly being criticised for its shoddy, slovenly reaction to the disappearance of Flight MH370. Alongside Malaysia in this blame game are a number of Asean governments, including Thailand's.
