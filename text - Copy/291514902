BEIJING: If two aircraft are flying in parallel, is it possible for a person to climb out of one plane to the other to disable the emergency locator transmitters?This was one of the questions asked by family members of Chinese passengers aboard MH370 during the briefing sessions, which ranged from technical aspects of the aircraft to the search and rescue mission.They zoomed in on the details, in desperation to find clues that could solve the mystery surrounding the disappearance of the aircraft.One of such questions raised in a meeting with the high-level delegation from Malaysia yesterday (Sunday) afternoon was related to the emergency locator transmitters (ELT) on the aircraft."Are there possibilities of any person climbing out of the aircraft when it is flying at a height of 10,000m to disable the emergency locator transmitters (ELT)?" one asked.Another woman wanted to know if the ELTs had an independent power supply, and requested to see the most-recent maintenance report showing the batteries had been changed.The families also requested for a detailed list of the assets deployed by all countries in the search and rescue mission every day, from the very beginning."The list should also tell us the set out and return time, as well as the search area," a woman representative said.The high-level delegation who met the families Sunday comprised deputy chief of mission of the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing Bala Chandran Tharman, Royal Malaysian Air Force Major General Affendi Buang, Department of Civil Aviation air traffic services director Ahmad Nizar Zolfakar and representatives from Malaysia Airlines.A family member demanded the presentation slides be in Chinese and not English, as the target audience were Chinese families.Another also requested the search and rescue team did land searches instead of just focusing on the ocean, as the families still hung on to the hope that the aircraft may have landed somewhere.The briefing ended on an amicable note with Affendi thanking the family members for their patience and cooperation that enabled the two-way communication in a good atmosphere.The situation Sunday was an improvement compared to the hostile mood during previous sessions.A total of 29 Chinese family members, who said they were unsatisfied with the perceived lack of substantial information during the briefing sessions in Beijing, arrived in Kuala Lumpur Sunday morning in search of the "truth".
