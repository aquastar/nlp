Four Chinese naval vessels are being called back from the South China Sea after Malaysia's prime minister, Najib Razak, declared that missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 was hijacked.Razak said on Saturday, a week after MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, that there is a "high degree of certainty" that the plane's communication systems were intentionally disabled. Military radar data also confirmed that the plane then flew west off course before turning northwest.While Razak said authorities are still looking into "all possibilities," the investigation is "entering a new phase" where the focus will turn back to the 227 passengers and 12 crew on board, meaning the massive international search operation in the South China Sea — where the plane was initially believed to have crashed — will be called off.At least 14 countries were participating in the search, with 11 sending a total of at least 25 military aircraft and 43 ships to aid in the efforts in the South China Sea.China had sent four vessels from the People's Liberation Army, including the Jinggang Shan, the largest in the Chinese navy, as well as the Kunlun Shan, another amphibious landing ship with flight decks capable of launching helicopters. The two other ships were the Mianyang Type 053H3 frigate and the Haikou Type 052C destroyer.China had also employed 10 satellites in the search efforts hoping to pick up debris from the Boeing 777-200. On Thursday, Chinese authorities released three images they believed could have been the parts of the plane, but a search of the region came up empty.On Saturday, China's official Xinhua news agency made its harshest attack yet on Malaysia's handling of the investigation into MH370, saying that "massive efforts have been squandered, and numerous rumors have been spawned, repeatedly racking the nerves of the awaiting families."The report also blasted Malaysian authorities, which did not notify other countries for nearly seven hours after MH370 lost contact, for its reluctance to share information "in a full and timely manner," which was intolerable for the relatives.
