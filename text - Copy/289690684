Malaysian detectives have now focused their investigation on the captain of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 plane, Zaharie Shah, a 53-year-old grandfather said to be a keen activist for the country’s opposition party.Intelligence agencies have cleared the vast majority of passengers on flight MH370, it has been reported, and police have turned their attention on the captain, co-pilot and crew members, and engineers who had contact with the plane.The captain has apparently taken centre stage for his support of Malaysia’s pro-democracy opposition party.On Sunday, unconfirmed reports suggested his wife and three children moved out of the family home the day before the flight went missing. However, Malaysia’s inspector general of police stressed that all 239 passengers were still under investigation.Officers have searched the homes of Captain Zaharie and Fariq Ab Hamid, his co-pilot, it also emerged. A Boeing 777 flight simulator Captain Zaharie had built is being analyzed for clues that could suggest he was planning to divert the plane deliberately.There were several reports yesterday that Captain Zaharie was an “obsessive” and “fanatical” member of the pro-democracy People’s Justice Party. It was claimed he was “incensed” after attending the trial and conviction of its leader, Anwar Ibrahim, recently and hijacked his plane in a “political protest.”But Sivarasa Rasiah, an opposition leader, rejected the allegations, saying it was “unthinkable” he could have been involved in terrorism.Mr Rasiah said Captain Zaharie was “a really likeable guy, a warm guy. There is absolutely no way he is doing this of his own volition.”
