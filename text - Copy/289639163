There's a nasty "ad" going around the Internet today. It purports to show an old Malaysia Airlines ad, which eerily predicted the horrible events that led to the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. It's horrible, it's wrong, and even worse, it's fake.Flight 370 remains missing, and depending on who you ask, it's either in Asia, or it crashed into the southern Indian Ocean, about 1,000 miles west of Perth, Australia. Over 200 people are on board, and their families are desperately awaiting word of their fate.This really isn't the time to be joking about it, if ever.The fake ad shows a jet in Malaysia Airlines livery, with the words "Our New Boeing 777 Lose Yourself On a Journey of Epic Proportions," and below it, another connected ad, saying "Wherever You Go No One Will Ever Know."I'm not going to post the full thing here, nor am I going to link to where it was posted, because it is just that bad. If you really want to see it, you know how to Google. As it stands, the tweet from whence it came has been re-tweeted over 3,000 times, and has garnered over 1,000 favorites.I'm also not one to go around chastising other people's jokes, mostly because we've all been known to make bad jokes before. But the problem with this one is that a lot of people think it's real, with commentary such as "why you shouldn't take marketing taglines lightly." And if there's anything I hate worse than a bad joke that doesn't make me laugh, it's when people believe random crap they saw on the Internet, just because it popped up on Twitter.How do I know it's a fraud?Well, first of all, it's terribly done, second of all, the plane in the ad is an Airbus A380, not a Boeing 777, and third, here's the main part of the real ad it was made from:There's no losing yourself there, unless it's because you're on an A380, which is huge, and you got lost in the shower, or something.So please, for the love of all that is good taste in this world, stop sharing the fake ad. Somebody might believe you.
