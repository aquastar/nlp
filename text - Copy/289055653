Mohammad Mallaeibeasir revealed that he was with Pouria Nour Mohammadi and Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza, the two passengers who boarded the still missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 with stolen passports.  According to Mallaeibeasir, 18, he and Pouria, 19, went to high school together in Tehran but they have not seen each other for two years after Mallaeibeasir relocated to Malaysia where he studies Business Information Technology. Without asking why they were there in Malaysia, Mallaeibeasir accommodated Pouria and Reza, 29, who he met for the first time, the night before the Flight MH30 took off. The next morning, Mallaeibeasir drove Pouria and Reza to the airport.Mallaeibeasir said that the two stayed in Malaysia for a week although they were supposed to stay there for three days only. Their tickets were bought in Thailand by a certain Iranian man named "Mr. Ali", ABC News and News Limited reported. Mallaeibeasir said he heard the two talking to a "Mr. Ali" over the phone.When they entered Malaysia, Pouria and Reza used their Iranian passports. When they boarded Flight MH370, both were heading to Europe. Pouria used a fake Austrian passport to visit his mother in Germany and to seek asylum there while Reza used a fake Italian passport to relocate to Europe, according to Ronald K. Noble, Interpol Secretary-General.Initially, the reports about the fake passports led to a theory that the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 passengers was related to terrorism. However, further details about Pouria and Reza failed to corroborate this theory.   Mallaeibeasir denied having prior knowledge about the stolen passports. He said that he only found out when Pouria's mother called him after the flight was reported to be missing. Moreover, he said that both travelled lightly although each carried a laptop.Authorities did not find any evidence that linked Pouria and Reza to terror groups.
