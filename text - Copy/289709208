Incident exposes weaknesses in observing immigration security protocols in the country’s airports.AS I am writing this column late Friday night, it is almost seven days since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing on March 8.It has been a week and the huge wide-bodied twin engine Boeing 777 is still missing despite one of the largest search operations conducted, with more than 40 aircraft and ships from 12 countries combing the seas 24 hours a day.My heart goes out to the 239 passengers and crew members on board.I cannot imagine the anguish and anxiety of their families, relatives and friends.My wife works for Malaysia Airlines in its call centre and she is having a torrid time facing snide, hurtful and downright insulting remarks from smart alecs.While I can perfectly understand the frustrations of those who have loved ones onboard MH370, it is not helpful for those not connected to post disparaging remarks.Malaysia incurs the wrath of China and some members of the international media for its initial response to the crisis.It was accused by relatives, especially those from China, for not releasing enough information and of giving conflicting information.Let me reflect on this. In this age of social media and instant postings, uploads and comments, one simply cannot accept every posting at face value as the whole truth and nothing but the truth.Such postings usually do not have the benefit of independent verification.I must admit, however, that the Malaysian authorities’ response could have been better.Since the matter is an airline issue it falls under the Transport Ministry.Other ministers, including the military and defence, should have forwarded all news through the Transport Ministry to avoid unnecessary and sometimes embarrassing comments like the two suspected of using stolen passport not looking like Asians.Come on, Asia is from Turkey to Siberia, from Mongolia to the Maldives, and Pakistan to the Philippines.Maria Sharapova is from Asia, and it turns out that the two passengers are Iranians, and Iran is part of Asia.And yes, they bear no resemblance to Mario Balotelli. But why is it always him?I am also disturbed with the release on the Chinese government website of satellite images supposedly showing pieces of debris from the plane located in at an area of the South China Sea near the flight path of MH370.This prompted the search parties to rush to conduct another sweep. They found nothing.The obvious questions that must be asked are: Why were the pictures only released several days after they were taken?Why were they not released immediately so that assets can be deployed to conduct an immediate search?As it turned out the Chinese ambassador later clarified that it was a mistake.This just shows that despite the good intentions, in a very fluid and dynamic situation like this, there will be conflicting reports.The international collaboration in the search efforts by so many countries, however, must be applauded.Even Japan, the Philippines and China have put aside their territatorial disputes to lend a helping hand.What disturbs me is the two passengers who managed to board the aircraft after slipping through check-in, airport security, immigration, right to the departure gate on stolen fake passports.The Prime Minister has stated that all immigration and security protocols in airports in the country comply with international standards.But sad to say, protocols are only as good as the implementation on a daily basis by the people on the ground.While protocol demands that passengers must produce their passport or IC for identification, more often than not the security staff only cross-check the passport to match the name on the boarding pass.They seldom check the photo in the passport against the person holding it.Believe me, I just went through the airport security at Sibu airport at 8.45pm just now.They just checked my IC against the boarding pass. They did’t even look at me.Three weeks ago I was travelling with my 14-year-old son out of Kuching International Airport.He was directed by airport security to take off his belt before screening. Well and good.However, they never asked me to do the same.Maybe my son fits the profile of a terrorist threat more than me.Coming back from KLIA, I was told to take off my belt.I duly comply as security is paramount but I was quite annoyed when other passengers were not asked to do likewise.It seems a daily occurance that enforcement of fundamental procedures is done selectively depending on who the security personnel on duty are.Even simple things like boarding by row numbers are not properly carried out.They would announce that, for convenience of passengers and faster boarding, passengers seated in rows towards the back of the plane should board first.But the staff do not actually check the boarding passes, so more often than not, it’s every man to himself.And how about the one passenger, one hand carry baggage that must not exceed five kilos?Once I saw this huge bag of mattress comforter walking towards me inside the plane.The item was almost as big as the passenger carrying it.All too often the cabin crew would express their frustrations at the apparent lack of enforcement by the ground security personnel.I can go on and on, but if there ever is a silver lining let’s hope that the saga of MH370 will serve as a wake-up call that we must fully, properly and effectively implement policies and procedures in a consistent and professional manner.Malaysia may have won an international award for best immigration services at our airports.To me the core duty of immigration controls is not how fast we clear the crowd but by how thorough we are in making sure that undesirable elements do not enter the country and those with stolen passports do not board planes and pose a serious safety risk.I hope that as you read this column on Sunday, MH370 is found and all passengers and crew safe and sound.Or at the very least we know what actually happens to the flight.
