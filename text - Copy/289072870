Batam (ANTARA News) - Indonesian Air Force Boeing A7303 combed the Malaka Strait in search of the missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) MH370 from Monday (March 10) to Tuesday, but in vain. "Indonesian Air Force aircraft has combed A to B spot area (at the suspected crash site of MAS MH370) back and forth in Malaka Strait to assist Malaysia in finding the missing plane," Commander of Air Base Ranai Lieutenant Colonel Aviator Andri Gandhy stated in Batam on Tuesday. Indonesian Air Forces search range spread from upper Aceh to Malaka Strait, and the search was carried out using electronic radar monitoring and optical pictures and videos. The search range from Aceh to Malaka Strait covered 100 to 200 nautical miles, about two to three hours of mileage per route at a height of one thousand to 15 thousand feet above the sea level. Indonesia also sent five Navy ships to help in the search for the missing plane along with the Malaysian and the Thai Navy. Meanwhile, National Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) deployed a SAR ship to help the search and evacuation of the crash victim by the time they find something significant. Seven Indonesians are reportedly on board the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 that left Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on Saturday morning (March 8). The MAS MH370 carrying 239 people was scheduled to land at Beijing International Airport at 6.30 a.m. local Beijing time. However the aircraft lost contact with Subang air traffic control at around 2.40 a.m. (*)
