Families of passengers on board the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner desperately await news of their loved ones at a hotel near a Beijing airport. Their frustration is growing after a massive sea and air search enters its fourth day with not a trace of the aircraft or the 239 people on board. The majority - 153 people on the flight - were Chinese citizens. Ms Wang is the daughter of one of the missing passengers. (SOUNDBITE) (Mandarin) MS. WANG, DAUGHTER OF MISSING PASSENGER SAYING: "For family members who lost contact with their relatives, the foremost concern is to find them, find out where they are and find out what happened. If there is no progress on search and rescue efforts, we hope they can increase efforts in investigating the possibility of hijacking." Flight MH370 bound for the Chinese capital vanished on Saturday shortly after it left Kuala Lumpur. Some family members are now travelling to Malaysia to wait for news. The wife, child, and father of Malaysian passenger Mohd Khairul Amri are waiting with other families in a hotel. (SOUNDBITE) (Bahasa Malaysia) SELAMAT, FATHER OF MH370 PASSENGER, MOHD KHAIRUL AMRI, SAYING: "For sure we hope to see him whether he is alive and in good condition, or whatever the outcome, we accept." The wife of Prime Minister Najib Razak visited the hotel to offer some support. These families had hoped to welcome their relatives home -- but now any glimmer of hope of seeing them alive is slowly fading.
