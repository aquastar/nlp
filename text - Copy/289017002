Puri, March 11 (ANI): Internationally acclaimed Indian sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik created a sand sculpture of the missing Malaysian airliner as he prayed for the lives of 239 passengers who were aboard the plane that went missing near South China sea. The disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner is an unprecedented aviation mystery, with a massive air and sea search now in its third day failing to find any confirmed trace of the plane or the people aboard. Dozens of ships and aircraft from 10 countries scoured the seas around Malaysia and south of Vietnam for the search operation with China deploying almost 10 satellites to help in the massive air and sea search for the fight, sources said.
