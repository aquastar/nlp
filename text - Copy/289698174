Islamabad: Quashing the media reports which said that the missing Malaysian airliner MH 370 could have potentially reached as far as Pakistan, Shujaat Azeem, special aviation assistant to the Pak PM, said that there is no chance of jetliner hiding in the country.He reportedly said that MH 370 vanished far away from Pakistani air space and was not traced on its radars, “so how it could be hidden somewhere in Pakistan”?Azeem said that his division is following all the developments in the missing jetliner incident and would provide full cooperation.Meanwhile, Malaysia has appealed for international help in the search for the plane across two corridors stretching from the shores of Caspian Sea to the far south of the Indian Ocean.Malaysian investigators are investigating the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on MH 370 for clues as to why someone on board flew it perhaps thousands of miles off course, the country's police chief said.
