PCID Statement on the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement for the BangsamoroThe Philippine Center for Islam and Democracy (PCID) welcomes the historic signing of the Comprehensive Agreement for the Bangsamoro (CAB) between the national government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The agreement sets the parameters for the Bangsamoro Basic Law, the drafting of which is anticipated to be completed before Congress opens. After over 17 years of the peace process between the government and MILF, sustainable peace seems to be within reach and with it, the transformation of Bangsamoro and Mindanao dreams to reality.Through the years, we have seen the initiatives and efforts to establish a peaceful and democratic relationship between national government and the Muslim liberation movements, from the MNLF to the MILF. We have been witnesses to the Bangsamoroâ€™s struggle for their identity, for fair and good governance, and for inclusive growth and development. We hope that with this agreement in place, the government can now work on the convergence of the two peace agreements forged with the MNLF and the MILF, and proceed to focus much needed attention on the socio-economic and political development of the region to attain genuine autonomy.We at PCID believe that this agreement, if realized, will provide a strong foundation for prosperity and inclusive growth, not just for the Bangsamoro but for all peoples of Mindanao and the entire country as well. We pray that the spirit of the Agreement will permeate the Bangsamoro Basic Law. We congratulate and thank our government, the MILF, the Bangsamoro and peace advocates, Malaysia for facilitating the negotiations, the ICG as well as all of those who supported the GPH-MILF peace process to its the successful conclusion.We give special thanks to the men and women of the negotiating panels for their unwavering commitment to peace, patience and perseverance as well as the men and women in the Office of the Presidential Adviser of the Peace Process.
