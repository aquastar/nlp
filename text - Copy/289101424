(CBC)At first, the search effort focused on the area near where last contact was made with the plane. In the days that followed, the area expanded to a radius of almost 200 kilometres.Land over the Malay Peninsula was added to the search, as well as the Strait of Malacca to Malaysia's west.A satellite reading then placed the plane's last location on two incredibly vast stretches: a northern corridor stretching over land to Kazakhstan and a southern sea corridor in the Indian Ocean.Further data analysis narrowed this location down to a general area about 2,500 km southwest of Australia. Several satellites and planes have spotted potential debris in the southern Indian Ocean, although nothing has been confirmed as related to Flight MH370.
