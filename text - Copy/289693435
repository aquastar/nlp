KAJANG, Malaysia - PKR leaders are fuming over a report in Britain's The Mail On Sunday that Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah, who piloted the Malaysia Airlines aircraft which went missing, is a "political fanatic" and "obsessive" supporter of Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.Anwar rubbished the claims and blamed Umno for creating the perception.Allegations that Zaharie had diverted the plane from its original Kuala Lumpur-Beijing path as he was upset with his (Anwar's) court verdict on sodomy was "absurd," the PKR leader said during a ceramah at Sungai Chua last night.The British newspaper reported that Zaharie, 53, was an "obsessive" supporter of Anwar and that hours before the doomed flight left Kuala Lumpur, it was understood that the pilot had attended Anwar's trial at the Court of Appeal.However, PKR leaders have denied Zaharie's presence in court.PKR communications director Fahmi Fadzil said: "I was in court during the two days but I can't remember seeing him.""I did not know who he was until news about the plane broke out last Saturday."PKR vice-president Tian Chua said it was irresponsible to make such insinuations without verification.Another vice-president N. Surendran said "there is not a drop of evidence to support such speculation. Let us be fair to the missing captain. He cannot answer for himself."
