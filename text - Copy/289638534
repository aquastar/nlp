March 16 (Bloomberg) -- As the sun set over Port Blair in the Andaman Sea during the past week, runway lights glowed to guide Indian aircraft searching for the missing Malaysian passenger jet back to land.Soon those sorties from the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands may stretch over the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean, as the focus of search efforts shifts south toward a region identified by Malaysia yesterday. Missions to scour a smaller area in the Bay of Bengal and the waters near Indonesia were put on hold today pending the new coordinates.“The Indian Ocean is daunting,” V.S.R. Murthy, the coast guard’s commander for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, said in an interview yesterday. “There is a massive amount of sea that will need to be searched, which will require many more planes, ships and international collaboration.”The Indian operations halted today already involved an area of 250,000 square kilometers (96,500 square miles), deploying ships and long-range aircraft to try and find Malaysian Airline Flight 370. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said yesterday the plane was deliberately diverted from its Kuala Lumpur-to-Beijing course, flying back westward before disappearing on March 8 with 239 people on board.Malaysia will probably send new search coordinates covering the Indian Ocean today, according to two Indian navy officials, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to discuss the matter.Earlier, Indian navy spokesman Harmit Singh said existing operations had been suspended pending new orders.Najib said the Boeing Co. 777-200’s last communication with a satellite puts it in one of two possible corridors: one stretching from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, or another from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.Malaysia said today India is among about two dozen countries it’s contacting for assistance to scour the corridors, including with maritime and air assets.The northern arc could have involved flight over India, and if MH370 took that route then “it seems as though the plane flew at commercial heights right over us and undetected,” Murthy said by phone. He was speaking from Chennai, formerly known as Madras, after flying there from Port Blair. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands lie off India’s east coast.Investigators largely discount the northeasterly track because the nations along that route have robust air-defense radar systems, and no evidence has turned up that the rogue plane flew into that airspace, according to a person familiar with the probe who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the information.An Indian Navy official has said the jet would have been detected by radar in the Andaman region, declining to be identified as he isn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.India maintains a military presence in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, seeking to counter Chinese maritime power as well as prevent attacks by pirates in key shipping routes. The archipelago of about 527 islands not far from Southeast Asia also attracts tourists seeking pristine beaches.The Indian search fleet includes P8I long-range maritime patrol, C-130J Hercules and Dornier planes, according to the nation’s government. Naval warships INS Saryu and INS Kesari are also assigned to the task, it said in a statement yesterday.Satellite transmission data analyzed by U.S. investigators showed that the Malaysian Airline System Bhd. jetliner’s most likely last-known position was in a zone about 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) west of Perth, Australia, said two people in the U.S. government who are familiar with the readings.Expanding the search into the Indian Ocean, the third-largest body of water in the world after the Pacific and Atlantic, greatly increases the challenge of the task.Even so, “so long as we don’t have any debris, at least there is still hope that the passengers will be found alive,” said Murthy.To contact the reporter on this story: Kartikay Mehrotra in New Delhi at kmehrotra2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Arijit Ghosh at aghosh@bloomberg.net Sunil Jagtiani
