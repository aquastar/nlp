Taiwan alerted China of potential attack on Beijing Int'l Airport in days before MH370 disappearanceThe Taiwanese Aviation Police Bureau reportedly alerted China's aviation regulators and Beijing authorities of a potential attack on Beijing Capital International Airport sometime last week, in the days before Malaysian Airlines flight 370 went missing while en route to the city.Bloomberg broke the story earlier today, and cited Ko Chang-liang, Taiwan's Aviation Police Bureau deputy chief, who stated that, "We cannot say the attack warning is related to the missing Malaysian jet at this moment." Nevertheless, this report potentially backs-up reports that MH370's disappearance could be linked to a terror-attack gone awry, although it's probably safer to hold off on wild speculation.A Taiwanese airline was contacted by a member of "a French anti-terrorism organization [who] said he called the airline after failing to reach Beijing airport authorities," and the call was relayed to Taiwanese authorities who later contacted Beijing. Whether or not the attack rumors are linked to MH370—and if so, whether or not further investigation could have saved the flight—still remains to be seen.
