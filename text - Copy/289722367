Top U.S. lawmakers on the House Homeland Security committee downplayed a terrorism connection in the disappearance of Flight 370 and said the focus is now on whether the pilot or co-pilot played a role.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R., Texas) said in an interview the fact that the flight pattern had been changed after the plane was in the air for an hour and other evidence suggest the pilot or co-pilot was responsible.“We just think it’s more likely that that was done by the pilot,” Mr. McCaul said of the plane’s sudden turn.The homes and of Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid were searched by Malaysian police Saturday.  The Malaysian Transport Ministry said in a statement that police were investigating all crew and passengers on board the flight as well as engineers who may have had contact with the aircraft before takeoff. The statement called this “normal procedure” and urged the public “not to jump to conclusions.”Mr. McCaul said laptops had been recovered from the pilot’s home, which could provide clues into his thinking and communications. No links to organized groups have been found.“The terrorism connection doesn’t seem to be that well established,” he said.Rep. Pete King (R., N.Y.), said on ABC’s This Week there’s been “no terrorist connections whatsoever, there’s been no terrorist chatter.  There’s nothing out there indicating it’s terrorists.  Doesn’t mean it’s not, but so far nothing has been picked up by the intelligence community from Day One.”He said the focus now is on the pilot and co-pilot.“There’s obviously something with the pilot and the co-pilot.  And that has to be drilled down on,” said Mr. King.He added he still has questions about the two Iranian men who boarded the flight with stolen passports, including why it was “so easy” for them to board the plane. Their ability to get on board, he said, “just creates a terrorist atmosphere.”Both lawmakers also faulted the Malaysian government’s handling of the probe, saying there was a lack of information and a resistance to involve international law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Interpol.Mr. McCaul said Malaysian authorities were cooperating with the U.S., but they’re not used to conducting complex investigations.“We’re not dealing with a highly sophisticated country when it comes to investigations and, frankly, this airline itself,” he said.“It’s frustrating because of the lack of knowledge and because were dealing with the Malaysian government and we’re not getting a lot of info,” Mr. McCaul said.Mr. McCaul said the full story of the plane’s fight might never be known.“I don’t know if we’re ever going to be able to find this plane and if you can’t get the black box, it’s a mystery,” he said.______________________________________________________ Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.
