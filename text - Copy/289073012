Two of the passengers on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 were travelling under false identities using stolen passports belonging to Italian Luigi Maraldi and Austrian Christian Kozel.  It is not yet known why the two men were using false identities, but they could have been stopped in Kuala Lumpur if the authorities had run the passports through INTERPOL’s Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database.  INTERPOL is concerned that this was not done.  “This is a situation we had hoped never to see. For years, Interpol has been asking why countries are waiting for a tragedy to happen before they introduce proper security measures at borders and airports,” said INTERPOL Secretary General Ronald K. Noble.  A growing problemHans Jørgen Bonnichsen, former head of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, told DR News that identity theft is on the increase.  “Three years ago, there were 12 million documents recorded in INTERPOL’s database. Today, there are 40 million, so this is a huge problem,” said Bonnichsen.  Bonnichsen believes that one of the problems is that some countries and airports, including Kuala Lumpur, have simply not connected up to the SLTD database.  Bonnichsen does not know how INTERPOL’s system is being used in Denmark, but in the past there has been criticism of the control of illegal immigrants at Copenhagen Airport.  Shortage of officersIn 2012, the police journal Dansk Politi ran a series of articles on the control of illegal immigrants at Copenhagen Airport.  The articles described how airport police had to turn a blind eye to illegal immigrants entering the country because they simply did not have enough officers.  At the time, it was estimated that 10-70 illegal immigrants were entering Denmark every day, and when Danish daily Berlingske Tidende took up the case again in 2013, there had been no positive developments.
