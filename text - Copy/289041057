The search for the missing airliner that vanished en route from Malaysia to China is reportedly focusing on Malaysiaâ€™s west coast, far from the opposite coast where the plane last made contact with air traffic control. Now in its fourth day, the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is being described as one of the greatest aviation mysteries in history. Some 239 passengers were on board, including two allegedly traveling on stolen passports.
