On Sunday, India put a hold on its search for the missing Malaysian Airline carrying 239 passengers and crew members. This was done at the request of the Malaysian Government who want to reassess the entire situation as they suspect the Boeing 777 must have hijacked and redirected hundreds of kilometres off the course. They are assuming that it is the hijacker who has flying skills would have only shut down all the communication systems in the plane.India has been helping Malaysia to search in predominantly two major areas: One around Andaman and Nicobar Islands and second further west in the Bay of Bengal. Both searches have been suspended but may resume.“The search operation is not over, we are on standby and are awaiting instructions from the Malaysians,” said a senior military official in the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Port Blair.“It’s more of a pause,” Commander Babu, a spokesman for the country’s Eastern Naval Command addressed the media and said, “It’s more of a pause. The Malaysian authorities are reassessing the situation. They will figure whether they need to shift the area of search.”Indian officials have said that a review of search operations involving more than a 12 countries will be held in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday and depending on the review, the Malaysian government will give further orders to India as to shift the location or resume the search in the reassigned location.Whatever the case may be, the vastness of the Indian Ocean is dramatically complicating the searchers’ difficulty. We hope the Malaysian Government soon finds out the location ad situation of the this flight so that the passengers and crew members’ families will too, be at peace.
