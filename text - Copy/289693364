Malaysian authorities on Sunday examined a flight simulator that was confiscated from the home of one of the missing jetliner's pilots and asked governments to divulge sensitive radar data, warning that without it, locating the plane in what is now a massive search area might be impossible.Authorities confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues on Saturday.Local media, meanwhile, were speculating on videos posted on YouTube in January 2013, allegedly showing Zaharie sitting in front of a flight simulator and speaking about how to improve the performance of air-conditioning units.Zaharie, 53, who has three grown children and one grandchild, had previously posted photos online of the simulator, which was made with three large computer monitors and other accessories.Earlier this week, the head of Malaysia Airlines said this was not in itself cause for any suspicion.Malaysia's government said police on Saturday searched the homes of both the pilot and the co-pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet.There is no evidence linking them to any wrongdoing.Zaharie and Fariq Abdul Hamid were described as respectable, community-minded men.Zaharie, the pilot of MH370, joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of experience.He was certified by Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation as a flight simulator examiner, according to Malaysia Airlines.Police also are investigating engineers who may have had contact with the plane before it took off.
