Six Thai fishermen accused of being involved in the murder of two Indonesian naval officers in Indonesian waters will soon surrender to police, a source in the police investigation team said yesterday.It is expected the Attorney General's Office will assign official investigators tomorrow, after a request from the Indonesian Embassy for a full probe. Last week police issued arrest warrants for 12 crew members of a Thai fishing boat, initially charging them with violating the Thai Immigration Act, and arrested three men.The source said the three men gave useful information and confessed to involvement in the killings, which were allegedly committed by eight crew including the captain.Police contacted the fishing company which the six men were working for in Malaysian waters and were told the company would present them either this Friday or Saturday or next Sunday.The men were identified as Lampian Khanthee, Nadda Khum-eard, Daeng Khanthamanee, Suthee Khiripop, Sorlae Pandika and Choom Yodwongsa.
