KUALA LUMPUR: There should not be any blame  game in the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines (MAS) flight MH370, said  MCA president Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai.Describing the incident as an ‘unprecedented mystery’, Liow said it had gone far beyond an aircraft disaster and demonstrated cross border, regional and inter-continental co-operation of sea and air by 26 countries.“It was never a one-nation exercise even from day one when various countries responded to Malaysia’s call for aid and countries have voluntarily offered search and rescue (SAR) assistance,” he said at the mass prayers for the missing MH370 at Wisma MCA here, yesterday.The prayer is organised by MCA with co-operation from the Malaysian Buddhist Association.Liow said Malaysia had taken comfort that the countries involved in the search had set aside all differences for humanitarian purposes. The humanitarian spirit and humanity displayed reminded us that irrespective of political alignment, creed and nationality, we were still of one race – the human race, he said.“The incident makes us value our precious life even more. It reminds us to love ourselves more, value our family and friends.“With a heavy heart, we still hold on to hope. Let us face this challenge and share the pain jointly and together, we can overcome the hardship,” he said.The prayer was also attended by family members of the flight MH370’s passengers from Malaysia and China and Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia, Dr Huang Hui Kang and about 300 Buddhists. — Bernama
