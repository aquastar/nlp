Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton matched Jim Clarke’s all-time British record of 33 pole positions as he went fastest in a rain-hit qualifying session for tomorrow’s Malaysian Grand Prix in Sepang.The Briton clocked a lap time of 1:59.431 in the final session to finish 0.055s ahead of reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel in second and 0.619s ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg in third.Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso will start in fourth after being pipped by Rosberg on the final flying lap, but the Spaniard will be happy enough with that after a collision with Toro Rosso’s Daniil Kvyat mid-way through the second session looked to have scuppered his chances of a good grid position for tomorrow.However, his team worked wonders to get the former champion back out on the track for the final session and he duly rewarded them with fourth place.Heavy rain showers just before the start of the first session caused a 50-minute delay to proceedings and made for treacherous conditions out on the track with plenty of surface water and significantly reduced visibility for the drivers.Rosberg, winner of the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne a fortnight ago, had been quickest in the first session. The German clocked 1:57.183 to finish ahead of Hamilton and Vettel in second and third respectively, but conditions quickly deteriorated.Hamilton was quickest after the second session in a slower time of 1:59.041, finishing ahead of Vettel and fellow Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo with Rosberg back in fourth.Speaking afterwards, Hamilton was delighted with how things had gone as he looks to kick-start his season after the disappointment of his early retirement in Melbourne."I'm all over the place at the moment,” he said. “I'm really happy with how well we've done over the weekend, but today was incredible - how heavy was the rain? It was tricky out there for everyone because at the end it was almost impossible to see. I couldn't see where the track went, where the corners were, where to break. I had to bail out of my final fast lap, so it was very close."
