KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Bernama) -- Fishermen nationwide, especially those venturing out to sea off the north and north-east region have been asked to report to the authorities if they spot any 'strange' object, in the event it is linked to the missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) Flight MH370.Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said there were an estimated 17,000 to 20,000 fishermen in Kelantan, Terengganu, Perlis, Penang and Perak, who could be mobilised to assist the authorities and professional bodies in the search for the aircraft."The fishermen can volunteer because this is where they make their living, and we believe they know the seas well. So, we hope they can inform us quickly if they see any 'strange' object," he said.Ismail Sabri said this at a press conference here today, after meeting the family of Khairul Amri Selamat, from Bera, Pahang, who was one of the passengers onboard the aircraft which disappeared from the radar screen early Saturday.Yesterday, Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein said he would discuss with Ismail Sabri the possibility of getting the National Fishermen Association to help in the search and rescue operation.Meanwhile, Ismail Sabri contacted his Indonesian counterpart yesterday to request for assistance from fishermen in Medan and Acheh who were operating in the Melaka Strait."Indonesia has given assurance that it will help. We will also convey a similar request to the authorities in Thailand and Vietnam, either today or tomorrow," he said.He also disclosed that pilots of small aircraft, such as the Twin Otter, had offered help to locate the aircraft.He said he would convey their message to Hishammuddin, who is also defence minister, to enable them to fly over the coastline of certain areas, upon approval by the Department of Civil Aviation.
