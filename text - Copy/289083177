KUALA LUMPUR: Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd said Toyota Tsusho Corp (TTC) of Japan has made an offer to buy 51% of its shares at RM3.74 per share which would put the offer at RM847.2 million.The offer from the trading arm of major Japanese conglomerate Toyota Corp will rival the pending RM1.47 billion offer by Kian Joo COO Chee Khay Leong and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) to acquire all the businesses and undertaking of Kian Joo for RM3.30 per share.“Subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence on Kian Joo and its related companies, the tentative maximum price per stock for the transaction would be RM3.74, to be satisfied in cash payable to sellers of the stocks,” said TTC MD Takumi Shirai in the letter to Kian Joo yesterday.Takumi clarified the price above could be recalculated without restriction or limitation after due diligence is done.Takumi said as the immediate next step, TTC will start detailed discussions regarding the key contents of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) document where upon execution of the MoU, TTC will begin its due diligence of Kian Joo.According to the letter, Takumi said TTC will be acquiring the shares with possible partner(s) and that Kian Joo is to grant TTC and its possible partner(s) an exclusive right during the term of the MoU to negotiate the possible transaction.TTC also asked for Kian Joo to not directly discuss or negotiate the sale or transfer of shares with any third party.On Nov 26, 2013, Aspire Insight Sdn Bhd, a company owned by Ekuiti Merdu Sdn Bhd and Alleyways Sdn Bhd, made the original offer. Ekuiti Merdu is wholly-owned by EPF, while Alleyways is majority owned by Chee.Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd’s senior VP Goh Han Hau had said in Dec 12, 2013, that the Aspire deal is very good for the minority shareholders.“Kenanga has consistently priced the fair value of Kian Joo at much lower than Aspire’s offer price, and without the offer there is no likelihood that minorities will get such a good price for their shares in Kian Joo.The attractiveness of the offer to the minorities is increased by the fact that the offer price is at 1.44x price/book, a premium to the 5-year average of 0.87x that Kian Joo has been trading at,” said Goh.Aspire has requested an extension of time for the completion of its ongoing due diligence exercise and the signing of the definitive agreement in relation to its offer and Kian Joo has agreed on the extension of time from Jan 31, 2014, to March 14.Kian Joo ended yesterday’s trading up three sen to close at RM3.21 with 108,300 shares traded.The can manufacturer has 446.158 million paid-up shares with Bursa Malaysia-listed Can-One Bhd owning 32.9% and EPF with 10.03% of the company’s shares.Kian Joo also owns 54.83% of Bursa Malaysia-listed Box-Pak (M) Bhd, which also made an announcement to the exchange about the news.This content is provided by FMT content provider The Malaysian Reserve
