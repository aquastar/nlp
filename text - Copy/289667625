If reports are to be believed, the evidence of a plot by Malaysian Islamists to hijack a passenger jet in a 9/11-style attack is being investigated in connection with the disappearance of Flight MH370.As reported by The Telegraph, an al-Qaeda supergrass told a court last week that four to five Malaysian men had been planning to take control of a plane, using a bomb hidden in a shoe to blow open the cockpit door. Security experts said the evidence from a convicted British terrorist was "credible". The supergrass said that he had met the Malaysian jihadists, one of whom was a pilot, in Afghanistan and given them a shoe bomb to use to take control of an aircraft.Foreign policy analyst - and former US Deputy Secretary of State - Strobe Talbott tweeted the possibility that an Indian city may have been the target of the attack.The Telegraph has reported that an al-Qaeda supergrass told a court last week that some Malaysian men had been planning to take control of a plane.The possibility of such a plot, hatched by the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers in New York, was bolstered after Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak admitted that the Boeing 777's communications systems had been deliberately switched off "by someone on the plane".Meanwhile, the Malaysian government is searching the homes of the pilot and co-pilot for more clues in the case.
