We’ve had quite a lot of analysis over the past week, but earlier today AP posted a good summary of the key pieces of evidence pointing to on-board sabotage.The transponder – a signal system that identifies the plane to radar – was shut off about an hour into the flight.That’s not a straightforward thing to do. Someone in the cockpit would have to turn a knob with multiple selections to the off position while pressing down at the same time, said John Goglia, a former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board.However, it could also be learned by someone who researched the plane on the internet, Goglia said.The Boeing 777’s Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (Acars) – used to send short messages via a satellite or VHF radio – was shut off.In most planes, the information part of the system can be shut down by hitting cockpit switches in sequence in order to get to a computer screen where an option must be selected using a keypad, said Goglia, an expert on aircraft maintenance.Again, that could be done by the pilot or someone who had researched the system.But to turn off the other part of the Acars, it would be necessary to go to an electronics bay beneath the cockpit. That’s something a pilot wouldn’t normally know how to do, Goglia said, and it wasn’t done in the case of the Malaysia plane. Thus, the ACARS transmitter continued to send out blips that were recorded by the satellite once an hour for four to five hours after the transponder was turned off.3. Guided flightAfter the transponder was turned off and civilian radar lost track of the plane, Malaysian military radar was able to continue to track the plane as it turned west.The plane was then tracked along a known flight route across the peninsula until it was several hundred kilometres offshore and beyond the range of military radar.Airliners normally fly from waypoint to waypoint where they can be seen by air traffic controllers who space them out so they don’t collide. These lanes in the sky aren’t straight lines. In order to follow that course, someone had to be guiding the plane, Goglia said.
