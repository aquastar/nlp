We cannot do that we will check on it.SAMANTHA HAWLEY: If you can't do that, why can you not do that?AZHARUDDIN ABDUL RAHMAN: Because there are - as I've told you, there are other angles that they are looking at, this syndicate of stolen passports. That's what they are looking at.SAMANTHA HAWLEY: Still terrorism hasn't been ruled out as all possibilities are being considered.The Malaysia Airways chief says all pilots follow the protocol of locking the cockpit door during flying time.AHMAD JAUHARI YAHYA: The cockpit door is kept locked all the time.REPORTER: Can it be opened from the outside?AHMAD JAUHARI YAHYA: It cannot be opened from outside.
