KUALA LUMPUR: Even as some Chinese nationals, unhappy with how Malaysia handled the MH370 incident called for a boycott of travel and trade with the country, a group of Chinese students here are actively countering the “irrational” move over social media.They have been using Twitter and WeChat to explain the Malaysian position to their countrymen back home.Malaysian Association of China Students Alumni president Adam Huang urged fellow Chinese not to create any uneasiness between the two countries which have been close since establishing diplomatic relations 40 years ago.Huang, who has been in Malaysia for 12 years, said the verbal abuse and boycott calls against Malaysia were inappropriate and being carried out by irresponsible people.“Malaysia may not have conducted the crisis management well in the first few days, but it is trying its best now,” he told a press conference at Wisma MCA in Jalan Ampang.“Their calls will not help resolve the MH370 issue,” he said when commenting on calls by some including Chinese celebrities who have called for a boycott of Malaysia.Huang was accompanied by 24 members of the 1,000-strong association which is two years old.He reminded fellow citizens of China that Malaysia had helped Chinese nationals in the past, especially when an earthquake hit China in 2008.“We want to let people in China know that Malaysia was the second-highest donor when the earthquake hit the country,” he said.Huang said about 3,000 students come to Malaysia annually for further studies, collectively spending close to RM1.2 million per year which works out to an average of RM40,000 each per year.He added that the alumni is in constant contact with the Chinese embassy here over the crash and is keeping its members informed of the latest developments.Meanwhile, the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM) has asked Malaysians to be calm amid growing unhappiness in China over the government’s handling of the MH370 incident.Its president, Datuk Lim Kok Cheong, said the media in China has understandably been overwhelmed by emotion over the incident.He said the matter had, however, got out of control due to comments by Chinese celebrities to boycott Malaysia.Meanwhile, association adviser Datuk Seri Michael Chong said he would try to assist members in their effort to convince fellow Chinese nationals not to boycott Malaysia.He said members had told him that they wanted to do something to improve the situation.
