PUNE: The two sons of Kranti Prahlad Shirsath, who was on the missing Malaysian Airlines flight to Beijing, were issued fresh passports on Tuesday so that they can travel to Malaysia from where the search operation is being controlled.Regional Passport Officer Narendra Singh told TOI that the decision to issue new passports was taken after the Ministry of External Affairs stepped in to offer help to the grief-struck family."The family is tensed. Rahul (16) and Yashwant (11) have passports but they need to be renewed. The boys approached me in my office today for help. I asked them to complete the formalities which includes getting the signature of their father on application forms. The procedure was completed by afternoon and new passports were issued immediately. They can now travel out of the country at the earliest," Singh said.Satish Shirsath, Prahlad's younger brother, who has come to Pune from Sangamner to be with the boys in the absence of their parents, expressed hope that the boys would be able to travel in a day or two."My elder brother will travel from Pyongyang to Pune. Rahul and Yashwant will travel with him to Malaysia. We have been assured by the Malaysian airline authorities and MEA of all possible helps. It has been four days since the plane disappeared. The children are getting restless and are scared too," Satish Shirsath said.
