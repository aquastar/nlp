PETALING JAYA - It has been over a week since MH370 disappeared - but the eyes of the world are still fixed on news about the Boeing 777 and its 239 passengers and crew.As of yesterday, British, American and Australian media have shown no signs of letting up on their coverage of the missing jet.The Guardian ran a story yesterday saying that the southern Indian Ocean, a spot in the search for the missing aircraft, was "one place where a commercial airliner can crash without a ship spotting it, a radar plotting it or even a satellite picking it up".It follows three other stories on Saturday, one focusing on the investigation into the two pilots at the helm of MH370 - Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid - where it was reported that police had made visits to their homes.The two earlier Guardian stories, uploaded on Saturday, focused on Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak's press conference where the Prime Minister said that MH370 had been deliberately diverted from its Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight path."I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate from its original flight path," he told reporters at the Sama-Sama Hotel in KLIA.This was also picked up by the BBC on Saturday, which quoted a friend of Zaharie, Peter Chong, as saying that he believed Zaharie was not behind the plane's disappearance on March 8.Other British media outlets took up a more sensationalist tack. Mail on Sunday, for instance, tried to draw yesterday a link between the plane's disappearance and the March 7 decision by the Court of Appeal which saw PKR supremo Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim sentenced to five years in prison for sodomy.Mail on Sunday had portrayed Zaharie as a "political fanatic", claiming that he piloted the doomed flight several hours after he was at the courthouse.Flight MH370 with 239 passengers and crew on board took off from KLIA at 12.40am the next morning.Across the Atlantic in the United States, CNN had also run two stories yesterday; one focusing on Zaharie and Fariq and another, citing a source, of US intelligence officials looking into the theory that the pilots were responsible for MH370's disappearance.
