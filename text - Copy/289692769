KUCHING: The growing permeability of mobile devices among Malaysians signify an opportunity for education providers – especially tertiary ones – to hop on this trend and widen their scope of services.Not only are smart mobile devices permeating the workplace, they are also very much a part of the modern day educational institution where more students expect to be able to use their personal mobile devices as part of the learning process.“Catering to the lifestyle of digitally savvy students and teachers is becoming a need, not an option,” highlighted Mark Micallef, Citrix Asean area vice president to The Borneo Post recently.“Educational institutions’ information technology (IT) teams are looking for an efficient IT infrastructure to manage applications and databases from a centralised point and deliver them securely and easily to a wide network of users.”This was pertinent to countries or states such as Sarawak, whereby geographical constraints can be a major roadblock in accessibility to education.“Today, education need not be limited by classroom walls,” Micallef added.“Deploying a combination of desktop virtualisation, mobile device management, and mobile app management  solutions can bring lessons to the students instead, enabling them to access the school’s virtualised desktop and applications from anywhere, at any time on their device of choice.”For instance, if a student misses a class, all he or she needs is a mobile device and an Internet connection to access the institution’s app and data in order to catch up on the class.“Online collaboration software allows faculty members to record their classes for students’ on demand viewing, making it convenient for students to revisit them.“Education is now wherever the student is, giving them the flexibility they desire to learn from wherever they are.”To this end, Citrix is providing an array of solutions to equip Malaysian players with the mobility solutions necessary to address this lack.According to the Citrix Mobility in Business survey released last year, 53 per cent of organisations in the region still lack formal mobility strategies. Citrix has been committed to helping organisations reap the benefits of enterprise mobility.“Adopting a formal mobility strategy empowers users to stay productive on the go from any device. At the same time, it enables IT to efficiently control information security and ensure regulatory compliance,” he said.“Citrix is working with organisations in many industries in Malaysia – including financial services institutions, telecommunications and service providers, retail, shipping and logistics, education, healthcare, government and manufacturing – to help them develop a formal mobility strategy which can help their organisations create a secure mobile workspace.“Citrix continues to simplify the delivery of enterprise mobility through market-leading cloud, collaboration, networking and virtualisation technologies.“This full suite of solutions is end-to-end, from desktop to mobile to apps, and in turn allows data to follow end users everywhere, while ensuring sensitive data security.”
