— Reuters picKUALA LUMPUR, May 16 — The authorities need to find answers to a list of 20 questions on 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), from its formation to the various deals that it has executed leading up to the string of controversies that have culminated in debts worth billions of ringgit, veteran newsman Datuk A. Kadir Jasin said today. Splitting his blog entry into three parts, Kadir said all parties that are investigating the state-owned fund - which includes the National Auditor-General’s Department, Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission (MACC), police and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) - must first look into all who were involved in the creation of 1MDB. He named former Employees Provident Fund (EPF) chief executive Tan Sri Azlan Zainol, Sime Darby president and chief executive Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh, 1MDB chairman and Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT) chief executive Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin and Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) chief executive Tan Sri Ismee Ismail as key witnesses, as they were founding directors of the Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA) which was initially intended to be the launchpad for 1MDB.
