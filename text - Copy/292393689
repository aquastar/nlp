MALAYSIAN professionals and students based in the United Kingdom (UK) have been called upon to take up dynamic career opportunities back home.This was the key message delivered when Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Datuk Seri Abdul Wahid Omar and corporate leaders met with Malaysians at the Corporate Luncheon 2014 organised by Graduan and UK and Eire Council of Malaysian Students (UKEC). The message was also delivered at professional networking sessions organised by Talent Corporation Malaysia Berhad (TalentCorp).“The presence of many corporate leaders from Malaysia who are here to engage with the Malaysian talents in the UK is testimony to the demand for top talents in Malaysia,” said Abdul Wahid when delivering the keynote address to more than 100 top Malaysian students at the corporate luncheon.He also elaborated on the strength and sustainability of the Malaysian economy, reinforcing the point of a bright future for returning Malaysian talents.The luncheon panel discussions featured corporate leaders such as PwC Malaysia executive chairman Datuk Faiz Azmi and OCBC Bank Malaysia Berhad chief executive officer Jeffrey Chew.Abdul Wahid also spoke to the student leaders of the respective Malaysian student societies at the UKEC Awards ceremony, calling on student leaders to invest in the time to understand the government’s development agenda themselves and not just rely on what others may say.“The Government is committed to creating a conducive environment; to allow future leaders to realise their potential and emerge as corporate or community leaders,” he said.More than 100 Malaysian professionals attended TalentCorp’s professional networking sessions at the Chartered Accountants Hall and Lancaster London Hotel.Corporate leaders such as Deloitte executive director Nizar Najib and Petronas Treasury vice president Nuraini Ismail shared the opportunities available for the Malaysian professionals based in London to return and advance their careers in Malaysia.TalentCorp also briefed the professionals on the revisions to the Returning Expert Programme which would take effect after April 15.For more information on TalentCorp’s Outreach and Engagement programmes, visit www.talentcorp.com.my. — Bernama
