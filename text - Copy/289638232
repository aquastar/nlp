The IGP also confirmed that experts are examining the pilot’s flight simulator.PETALING JAYA: The police have expanded their investigation into a possible hijack plot of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 to everyone involved in the aircraft, from ground staff to flight engineers.Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, speaking in his daily press conference, said the authorities were refocusing their investigation on all crew and passengers on board MH370, as well as all ground staff who had handled the aircraft.Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar, who was also present at the press conference, added: “We are investigating everyone involved, passengers, crew, engineers, ground staff, even the persons who pulled the aircraft”.The minister also  confirmed reports that the police had searched the homes of the plane’s two pilots yesterday.Earlier a statement from the Transport Ministry stated that police officers spoke to family members of the pilot (Zaharie Ahmad Shah) and experts were examining the pilot’s flight simulator.At the media briefing, Khalid said the police were waiting for experts to inspect the flight simulator.The spotlight turned on the missing jetliner’s passengers and crew, especially on pilot Capt Zaharie and First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, after Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak’s confirmation yesterday that the plane was deviated from its original course due to deliberate action.Najib had confirmed that the communications systems and the transponder of MH370 were deliberately disabled.He said that based on satellite and radar evidence, the plane then changed course and could have continued flying for a further seven hours. He added the “movements are consistent with the deliberate action of someone on the plane”.The plane disappeared on March 8 with 239 people onboard while it was on its way to Beijing. It lost contact with air traffic control as it headed east towards the South China Sea, about one hour after take-off.When asked by reporters if there were any passengers with flying skills and knowledge in the flight, Khalid said that the police were waiting for background checks on passengers from other nations.“But a few international intelligence agencies have cleared all names,” he said.Both Hishammuddin and Khalid appeared very guarded in answering questions on possibilities of hijacking or sabotage of the missing plane.Hishammuddin said he didn’t want to comment on speculative theories as to what might have caused the deviation from the original flight path.“I do not wish to prejudice the on-going investigation. I understand the hunger for new details. But we do not want to jump to conclusions.“Out of respect to the families, and the process itself, we must wait for the investigation to run its course,” he said.He also said that according to Malaysian Airlines, the pilot and co-pilot did not ask to fly together on MH370.Following the new discovery, the authorities are now searching for the missing plane in two sectors – the northern corridor stretching from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, and the southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian ocean.Hishammuddin said government officials were currently discussing with all partners on how best to deploy assets along the two corridors.He said officials were contacting countries along the northern and southern corridors about MH370.“Officials are requesting assistance from these countries. They are asking countries to provide further assistance in the search for the aircraft, including: satellite data and analysis; ground-search capabilities; radar data; and maritime and air assets,” added the minister.He also said that both the northern and southern corridors were being treated with equal importance.He further said the search area has expanded – from focusing mainly on shallow seas, now to large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans.The number of countries involved in the search and rescue operation has increased from 14 to 25.Hishammuddin also revealed that in the last 24 hours, Najib has spoken to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the President of Turkmenistan, the President of Kazakhstan and Prime Minister of India.And today the Foreign Ministry briefed representatives from 22 countries, including those along the northern and southern search corridors, as well other countries that may be able to help.“We are asking countries that have satellite assets, including the US, China and France amongst others, to provide further satellite data.“And we are contacting additional countries who may be able to contribute specific assets relevant to the search and rescue operation.“Surveillance aircraft are required, and maritime vessels are needed, particularly for the southern corridor,” said Hishammuddin.
