KUALA LUMPUR: China has expressed satisfaction with the efforts taken by the Malaysian government so far in the search for a missing Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight that had Chinese nationals as the most number of passengers.China’s Ambassador to Malaysia, Dr Huang Hukiang, said there might have been some criticism by the Chinese authorities and relatives of the passengers over what they felt was some delay but this had been clarified to them.“There was some criticism, but it seems to me that so far the Malaysian government has done a lot to carry out the emergency rescue operation and cooperate with the Chinese government in dealing with the demands raised by the family members of the passengers.“I have already spoken to the Chinese media. I said the rescue operation so far has been orderly carried out.“From the first day, I witnessed the rescue operation running smoothly and received all the reports from the departments involved,” he told the media when making a courtesy call on Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Pandikar Amin Mulia at Parliament House, here.Huang said the Chinese government valued greatly the efforts undertaken by the Malaysian government, including providing aid to the next-of-kin of the passengers here and in Beijing.Flight MH370 had 153 Chinese nationals among the 227 passengers on board. The Boeing 777-200ER disappeared over the South China Sea about an hour after taking off from the KL International Airport at 12.41 am on Saturday.Huang said he hoped that the relatives of the passengers would continue to exercise patience and pray that the aircraft would be found.A multinational search team is scouring the South China Sea for the aircraft.“We should share the burden during difficult times. We appreciate the Malaysian government’s efforts so far and we will work together in handling the matter.“We must be calm and patient because many things are beyond human knowledge. We should wait and pray for whatever possible outcome,” he added. — Bernama
