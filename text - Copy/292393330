JOHOR BAHARU, April 6 (Bernama) -- Malaysian Pepper Board is looking to expand the hectarage of pepper farms in Peninsular Malaysia following increased interest on the commodity globally.  Malaysia is the fifth biggest pepper producer in the world with 98 percent of its total 14,000 hectares of pepper farms located in Sarawak.  Johor Regional Office Branch Manager, Stephen Mariasomalia said currently, Peninsular Malaysia has 200 hectares of pepper plantation area and the board plans to add on another 70 hectares this year.  "We have pepper farms in Melaka, Perak, Kedah and Terengganu. We are planning to establish more pepper farms in these states, as well as in Kelantan and Pahang," he said to Bernama in an interview.  "Our major focus is to increase pepper activities. We can facilitate anyone who comes with a bigger plan, but we are mostly looking at small holders," he said.  For this year, the interest to plant peppers has been on the high with the board receiving more than 100 applications.  "The board mainly contributes on the technical side which means teaching them how to identify good planting materials, and later on, how to select the right soil or land.  "We provide the materials, and for bigger scale farmers, we provide post-harvest equipment, such as the machine to remove pepper berries from the stalk," he said.  The board, however, he said, does not provide financing facility.  Mariasomalia also said that the board has developed several products under the brand "Sara Spice", and is looking for more local distributors.  Those interested can contact the board's Johor Regional Office at 07-5986485 or visit its website at www.mpb.gov.my for more details.  -- BERNAMA
