PKR de facto leader Anwar Ibrahim sees red over Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak's press conference that was held yesterday.KAJANG: Opposition Leader Anwar Ibrahim criticised Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak for not taking questions from the media following his first press conference on the missing MH370 yesterday afternoon.“It is the first press conference by the Prime Minister but what took place was a speech delivered by him. No questions were allowed,” said the PKR de facto leader while delivering an address in a forum targeted for Indians here in the run-up to the state seat by-election on March 23.“He said maybe this, maybe that and questions would be addressed at 5.30pm but then there was no press conference at 5.30pm,” he added.Anwar has been consistent in his criticism on the manner the government has been handling the missing Malaysia Airlines search and rescue efforts and the ongoing investigations.Last week he said Najib’s weak leadership in handling the missing flight crisis has caused Malaysia’s image to be tarnished in the international circle.“He does not know how to handle the matter,” he had said in another ceramah in Kajang.“A nation in crisis needs strong leadership. The leadership failure here is what the whole world is watching now,” he had added.Yesterday afternoon, Najib said MAS flight MH370′s main communication system was switched off and its turning back was ‘consistent with deliberate action”, but the prime minister stopped short of saying that the plane had been hijacked.Najib also confirmed that the MH370 turned towards east coast of Malaysia and headed towards Andaman Sea.He also confirmed that the unidentified aircraft, which made a turn towards at the east coast of Malaysia before turning towards the Andaman seas, was indeed flight MH370.‘Najib will have to lead’Speaking last night, Anwar said that Najib should take the bull by its horn and lead the nation out of the crisis.“You are the Prime Minister and you have to lead. You should show the world that you are prepared to lead because you are a leader,” said Anwar.The forum was organised by Centre for Reform Democracy and Social Initiatives which is led by its executive director Edmund Santara. It was held at New Era College.This is the second time PKR is engaging the Indian community in relation to the Kajang by-election.The March 23 state seat by-election will see a straight fight between PKR president Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail and MCA vice president Chew Mei Fun.The Kajang state seat fell vacant following the resignation of incumbent assemblymen Lee Chin Cheh of PKR on Jan 27 which is PKR’s grand plan code named the Kajang Move.The state seat comprises 39,728 registered voters. At the last general election in May 2013, the seat saw a voter turnout of 87.9% with 541 spoilt votes.
