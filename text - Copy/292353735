KUALA LUMPUR: Support among mankind is strength that helps people cope with life’s many adversities, says Malaysian Buddhist Association president Ven Jit Heng.Describing the support as da ai (universal love), he said this, together with a person’s ability to cope, made a lot of difference.Ven Jit Heng assured this to more than 3,000 people at a mass prayer for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 that was organised by the MCA at Wisma MCA here yesterday.About 20 Chinese families and two Malaysian families whose loved ones were on board the ill-fated flight were also at the prayer session.MCA president Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said everyone wished for the safe return of all on board Flight MH370 as soon as possible.“At the same time, we are also doing whatever possible to render support and care for their loved ones,” he said.Liow said the support and help between people and countries were of utmost importance during this difficult time.“Every effort possible is being taken to locate the plane since its disappearance 30 days ago, and 26 countries have join forces for that,” he said.Liow said acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein had reiterated that the search mission would continue, no matter how remote the hope was.He said he understood how hard it was for the family members who were pining for the return of their loved ones.The MCA crisis relief squad (CRSM), led by party vice-president Datin Paduka Chew Mei Fun, had been helping the Chinese families shortly after the plane went missing.Chinese ambassador to Malaysia Huang Hui Kang said he was touched by the support offered by so many Malaysians since March 8.MCA secretary-general Datuk Seri Ong Ka Chuan said “holding on to even a ray of hope is important as miracles could happen”.The ceremony also saw Liow, his deputy Datuk Dr Wee Ka Siong, Ong, other MCA leaders and masters of Buddhist groups praying on stage.
