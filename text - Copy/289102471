Investigators probing the baffling disappearance of a Malaysian plane with 239 people aboard today identified a 19-year-old Iranian man as one of the two persons who travelled on stolen passports but said he is "not likely" to have terrorist links."We have identified (one of the two persons travelling on stolen passports as) an Iranian by the name of Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad. He is 19-years-old and he is an Iranian, we believe that he is an Iranian," Inspector General of Police  Khalid Abu Bakar said in Kuala Lumpur.Criminals and illegal migrants regularly travel on fake or stolen documents."We have been checking his background. We have also checked him with other police organisation on his profile and we believe that he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group. We believe that he was trying to migrate to Germany," he said.Authorities were in contact with the Iranian's mother in Germany, who has been expecting her son to arrive in the city of Frankfurt, he said.The investigation into the fate of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 widened with authorities questioning travel agents about the two men who boarded the plane with stolen passports of an Italian and  an Austrian.The Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200 plane had 227 passengers on board, including five Indians and one Indian-origin Canadian, and 12 crew members.The police chief said that they had not finalised their probe on the other passenger who used a stolen passport.     "On the other person who travelled on the stolen passport, we are still conducting our investigation," he said.Another Iranian man named Kazem Ali bought one-way tickets for the two men, describing them as friends who wanted to return home to Europe ,Thai police said.While Ali made the initial booking by telephone, either he or someone acting on his behalf paid for the tickets in cash, police said."We have to look further into this Mr Ali's identity because it's almost a tradition to use an alias when doing business around here," Police Lt Colonel Ratchthapong Tia-sood said.The travel agency's owner, Benjaporn Krutnait, told The Financial Times she believed Ali was not connected to terrorism because he had asked for cheapest tickets to Europe and did not specify the Kuala Lumpur to Beijing flight.The search for the missing plane entered the fourth day,as 34 planes, 40 ships and teams from ten countries were involved in search operations that were widened to a 100 nautical mile (185 km) radius from the point the plane was last detected.     There was still no trace of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane on Tuesday, a day after authorities questioned travel agents at a beach resort in Thailand about two men who boarded the flight with stolen passports, part of a growing international investigation.Two impersonators travelled by the flight MH370 posing as an Italian and Austrian.   The stolen passports, one belonging to Christian Kozel of Austria and the other to Luigi Maraldi of Italy, were entered into Interpol's database after they were taken in Thailand in 2012 and 2013, the police organization said.     Contact with Malaysia Airlines flight was lost on Friday as it was flying over the Ho Chi Minh city air traffic control area in Vietnam.The mystery over the missing Malaysian aircraft with 239 people on board continued for the third day today even as the multinational search operations to look for the wreckage widened to cover the Andaman Sea near Thailand's border."Unfortunately, we have not found anything that appears to be objects from the aircraft, let alone the aircraft itself," Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, head of Malaysia's  Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), said at a news conference.Hopes for finding some clue about the missing jet arose when authorities reported traces of oil slick and some object floating in the sea in the area where the aircraft went missing. But the reports were denied today."This unprecedented missing aircraft mystery -- it is mystifying and we are increasing our efforts to do what we have to do," he said.Five Indians and a Canadian of Indian-origin were among the 239 people on board the Beijing-bound flight MH370 when it disappeared over the South China Sea one hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.Thirty four planes, 40 ships and teams from ten countries are involved in search operations. Rahman said the DCA is expanding the area of search operations in the next few days. He said right now they just cannot speculate what happened to the aircraft as it has not been found.
