PETALING JAYA: Charged with anger, families of over 30 Chinese passengers of MH370 vented out their frustrations today accusing Malaysian leaders of "covering up the truth" to the disappearance of the MAS airliner in a fiery press conference here today.Holding up banners and speaking in Mandarin, the 30-odd family members of about 35 passengers who arrived Malaysia today lashed out at an announcement made by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak on March 24 that the flight path of MH370 ended in the Indian Ocean.The banners read "Hand us the murderer. Tell us the truth", "Return our relatives of MH370", Relatives of MH370 strongly condemn Malaysian government's delay of rescue time.""The Malaysian government has concluded the end of MH370 based on speculation. We cannot accept this. Tell us the truth, we want our missing family members back or evidence the aircraft crashed," said a family member at the 15-minute press conference at the Holiday Villa hotel in Subang Jaya where they are putting up at about 2.30pm.They accused Najib of being a liar and demanded that he retract his announcement on the fate of MH370.The Chinese families also questioned flaws in the investigations and said they want a meeting with the technical team investigating the case to be arranged.After the press conference, the group was accompanied out by MAS security personnel who were stationed at the hotel to watch over them.It is learnt that MCA vice-president Datin Paduka Chew Mew Fun and former MCA president Tan Sri Ong Ka Ting, who are heading a high-level delegation to mediate the case, had met the Chinese families earlier with China's ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang.Meanwhile, MAS group chief executive officer Ahmad Jauhari Yahya issued a statement at 4pm saying the airline would make arrangements to fly the family members as soon as physical evidence of the MH370's wreckage is found."The airlines will bring the family members to the site where the wreckage will be kept as soon as the relevant government agencies provide clearances for MAS.A Family Assistance Centre (FAC) will be established in Perth for the families where planned briefings and religious services will be held.
