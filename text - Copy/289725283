UNITED NATIONS, United States: Russia vetoed a Western-backed resolution condemning the Crimea referendum at a UN Security Council emergency vote Saturday, but China abstained, isolating Moscow further on the Ukraine crisis.The draft resolution, which says yesterday’s referendum would have no validity, got 13 votes in the 15-member council. But it was rejected when permanent member Russia exercised its veto.The resolution declares that the referendum on whether the semi-autonomous region should come under Kremlin rule “cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of Crimea.”China often backs Russia at the council, especially on Syria-related votes, and Western powers presented its abstention as the best possible outcome from the seventh UN emergency session since the crisis began.“Russia, isolated, alone and wrong, blocked the resolution’s passage,” US ambassador Samantha Power told the council.“This is a sad and remarkable moment.” US national security advisers assembled at the White House to discuss Ukraine. President Barack Obama was not there but was being briefed, a senior US official said.“Russia totally isolated at UNSC. 13 vote for Resolution. Even China abstains. Russia alone in refusing to affirm sovereignty of üUkraine,” US Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes tweeted. — AFP
