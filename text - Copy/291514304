Fresh from Beijing, Chinese kin of MH370 stage protest in MalaysiaRelatives of the missing MH370 Chinese passengers stage a protest at the Subang Jaya Holiday Villa, March 30, 2014. — Picture by Saw Siow Feng SUBANG JAYA, March 30 — Just hours after flying into Kuala Lumpur, some 50 relatives of the jetliner’s Chinese passengers demonstrated at the Subang Jaya Holiday Villa here in protest against what they alleged to be an official cover up behind the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.They had claimed that Malaysian representatives in Beijing had only given conflicting explanations, driving them to come all the way here to get answers from the government.Some held aloft banners that read in Chinese and English: “You must return relatives of MH370, no strings attached” and “Hand us the murderer”.“We want our family back, we want the truth,” chanted the relatives in Mandarin, after a spokesman delivered a statement, also in the same Chinese dialect.They were clad in the same uniform white shirts which they wore during the march to the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on Tuesday.The relatives also did not reply when asked by reporters about how long they will be staying in Malaysia.The spokesman, who identified himself as Jiang Hui, said the relatives decided to come to Malaysia to get information first hand.He claimed officials in Beijing always had to clarify with their Malaysian counterparts before answering their queries.The group also asked for Boeing, Rolls Royce, Inmarsat, and any other manufacturers involved with the missing plane to meet them directly, as Malaysian officials could never provide them with answers to technical questions.Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak announced last week that the plane with 239 people on board was lost in the Indian Ocean on March 8 after being mysteriously diverted thousands of miles off course.He said the conclusion was based on satellite data and other calculations.
