KUALA LUMPUR – Malaysian police said Tuesday they had identified one of two men who boarded a missing Malaysian jet with fake passports as a 19-year-old Iranian believed to be seeking to emigrate to Germany.The man has been identified as Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, Malaysia’s national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters.Khalid said the 19-year-old boarded the plane on an Austrian passport whose owner had previously reported it stolen.“We have been checking his background. We have also checked in with other police organisations on his profile,” Khalid said.“We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terror group and we believe he was trying to migrate to Germany.”Khalid said authorities had not yet identified the other man.Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared early Saturday with 239 people aboard, sparking an international search for the plane in waters off Southeast Asia.Revelations that two passengers on board were travelling on EU passports -- one Austrian, one Italian -- that were stolen in Thailand had fuelled speculation of a security breach and possible terrorist attack.Asked why police believed the man was seeking to emigrate to Germany, Khalid said authorities had been in contact with his mother, who was waiting for him to reach Frankfurt.Mehrdad and the other man, who used the Italian passport but has not been identified, both arrived in Kuala Lumpur on February 28.Khalid said Malaysian police had been in touch with their counterparts in other countries, including Iran.However, he said police were still considering all possibilities in terms of criminal involvement in the plane’s disappearance, when asked whether police thought the revelation made them consider terrorism less likely in the case.“At this moment, I would not say less likely. Same weightage to all until we finish our investigations,” he said.Khalid said police were focusing their investigations on various theories including a hijacking, sabotage or psychological problems among passengers or crew.He did not elaborate and said none of those scenarios had yet turned up any findings.The plane’s disappearance has left authorities, the airline, passengers’ families and aviation industry flummoxed at how a huge Boeing 777-200 jet could have completely vanished during its overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.Search efforts involving several countries including China and the United States have found no evidence pointing to the plane’s fate. The plane emitted no distress signal or other signs of trouble.Investigators broadened their search to the Strait of Malacca after military radar tracks suggested that Malaysian Airline System Flight 370 may have tried to turn back to Subang, near Kuala Lumpur.Search and rescue teams from nine countries have been scouring the waters off Vietnam for days, but there is still no sign of the jet, which disappeared while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard.The search originally focused on the Gulf of Thailand, between Malaysia and Vietnam, then was broadened to the west as well as eastward to the South China Sea.“It’s disturbing the aircraft hasn’t been found,” said Louis Sorrentino, Jupiter, Florida-based managing officer of ICF International’s aviation safety, security and regulatory compliance practice. “The 777 is a huge aircraft and debris should be visible.”The Gulf of Thailand, where most of the search was conducted earlier, is only 269 feet deep, and therefore a wreckage plume would be visible, Sorrentino said. “It begs the question that maybe the aircraft dived straight down and embedded in the seabed.”The aircraft, which disappeared without providing any distress signal, may have made an “air turn-back,” Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein had said earlier.That means the plane may have deviated from its planned route, said Malaysian Air Chief Executive Officer Ahmad Jauhari Yahya. The pilots never signaled trauma or danger before losing radio contact between Malaysia and Vietnam.The last known position of MH370 before it disappeared off the radar was 065515 North (longitude) and 1033443 East (latitude).The search for Flight 370 has left authorities confounded as to how a jet with one of the industry’s best safety records could vanish without a trace, even after days of patrols by surface vessels, planes and helicopters.
