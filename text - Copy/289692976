Why is the government struggling to handle the MH370 missing jet calamity?Umno seems to have an ‘issue’ with learning from history. First, its politician-ministers have for over a week been befuddling everyone with details on the missing Malaysia Airlines’ Boeing 777 jet.If being slammed by the international media like CNN for its inefficiency in tackling the disappearance of the MH370 plane was not bad enough, the Umno-dominated Malaysian government continued behaving in a sloppy manner.This time, the Malaysian government despite being provided with the best know-how and by over a dozen countries, threw caution to the wind by turning to the ‘comforts’ provided for by a bomoh or shaman.This despite Islam prohibiting black magic and regarding it as shirik or sin. Still, this did not stop Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Jamil Khir Baharom who ironically is assigned to Islamic affairs from welcoming one such shaman on board to trace the missing MH370 flight which was originally destined for Beijing.Jamil Khir had on Monday taken the liberty of saying:“The government welcomes any help to trace missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 including from “bomohs” (shamans) so long as their methods do not contravene Islam.“We appreciate all help…but where it comes to mysticism, the methods used must conform to Islamic teachings.”Jamil Khir was commenting on the case of Ibrahim Mat Zin, a well known local bomoh, who came to the KL International Airport on Monday, claiming to be invited by one of the country’s top leaders, to help locate the missing plane using spiritual methods.After performing a prayer at KLIA’s entrance, Ibrahim said he thought the plane was still in the air or had crashed into the sea.If Ibrahim’s prophecy is all that matters, why trouble the international experts who are working tirelessly to detect the missing plane?Malaysia turns to shaman for helpWhile Jamil Khir clearly said the federal government was all for a shaman provided he did not deviate from Islamic teachings, his statement however was contradicted by his colleague, fellow minister in the Prime Minister’s Department, Shahidan Kassim who denied that the Najib-led government had ever turned to a bomoh to solve the mystery of the missing MH370.“No, this is not a directive from the government. It is not likely that we would have sanctioned any move which was against Islamic practices,” Shahidan had said when asked to comment on Jamil Khir’s ‘aye’ to a shaman.Shahidan added that allegations linking the bomoh, who is famous among VIPs, with Umno should not have come up in the first place.Shahidan also said it was not necessary that a bomoh who reportedly wore a 1Malaysia badge as did Ibrahim was an Umno member and hired by the party.So now it is a case of Jamil Khir versus Shahidan Kassim on the issue of ‘bomoh aid to find MH370 plane’.Even at a time so grave and excruciatingly painful for the families and friends of those on board the missing jet, our politicians refuse to get their act in order and are playing their own ‘politics’.Whether the government accepts or refutes, the truth is the episode surrounding the missing MAS plane has slapped the BN/Umno administration with a very costly lesson – ‘think first before speaking’.For over a week, a lot of embarrassment has come Malaysia’s way no thanks to the inept performance of its government and relevant authorities in handling tragedy of the missing jet.When Umno politicians decided to take the easy way out by turning to a shaman or bomoh to help locate MH370 plane, it revealed a ‘plague’ eating away at Malaysia’s core, its ‘third class mentality’ notoriety, a ‘legacy’ of the country’s fourth and longest serving prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad.With experts doing all they can to detect the jet, is is perturbing as to how and why did Jamil Khir entertain the thought of a bomoh coming to the Malaysian government’s rescue?Did it not bother the government that hunting for a bomoh’s help would anger both the worldwide community aiding it and the relatives and families of all those on board the ‘missing in action’ MH370?Performing the solat hajat for the safety of the passengers and crew is much needed but manipulating ‘spiritual’ energy is definitely a ‘no no’.And what makes Jamil Khir think that families and relatives of those on board the missing jet are comfortable with a bomoh’s abracadabras?Why was Jamil Khir’s bomoh intention not debunked by premier Najib or politicians from the Barisan Nasional coalition?Struck by a tragedy that continues to remain a mystery, the least politicians from the Umno/BN camp can do is to offer common sense suggestions instead of resorting to quick fixes.The clock is ticking away and with it the chances of survival of everyone on board MH370 and yet ministers like Jamil Khir had the luxury of indulging in the antics of a bomoh?Why is the government struggling to handle the MH370 missing jet calamity? Why is there the need to feign the ‘being in total control’ drama and end up misleading and confusing just about everyone connected to this mishap?It has been over a week since the MH370 piloted by Zaharie Ahmad Shah and assisted by Fariq Abdul Hamid disappeared. And throughout the ordeal, the Malaysian government has been lambasted by the international media for its lousy handling of this mishap.If that was not shameful enough, seeking the comfort of shamans has confirmed that Umno’s ‘third class mentality’ is here to stay.
