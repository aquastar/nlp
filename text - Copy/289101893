China's Ministry of Public Security has sent a team to Malaysia to investigate the disappearance of Flight MH-370. The team arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday morning, and has been working with Malaysian authorities to find out what happened to the plane. In a news conference, team leader Liao Jinrong briefed the public on their work."In the past two days, we were with the Malaysian law-enforcement authorities all the time. The two sides are analysing important clues together, carrying out separate investigations, and then sharing the results. I think the cooperation is efficient. Interpol and police from other countries have given much support. The most difficult part of the investigation is that we donâ€™t know the scene of the accident. We can only carry out our work following some clues relevant to the plane. But we will grab every little detail." Liao said.
