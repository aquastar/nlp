Syabas is one of the four companies involved in the deal reached by Selangor and Putrajaya. – The Malaysian Insider pic, March 11, 2014.Putrajaya will invoke the law to acquire Selangor water concessionaires that failed to meet a deadline for a RM9.65 billion deal that both hope will mitigate water shortages in the country's richest state.In a statement today, Selangor said Putrajaya will use Section 114 of the Water Services Industry Act 2006 to take over the four firms as part of a larger effort to restructure the industry to put it under one company controlled by the Selangor government."The Federal Government through the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water (KeTTHA) shall now pursue the exercise of its rights and powers under the Water Services Industry Act 2006 (WSIA)."(This is) to assist the State Government in implementing the proposed restructuring and consolidation of the Selangor water supply industry," Putrajaya said in a joint statement issued by the ministry and the Selangor Menteri Besar's office.Putrajaya's move is critical in the Pakatan Rakyat Selangor administration's  efforts to repair weaknesses in the state's supply of treated water to 7 million residents, and to fulfill one of its key promises during the 13th general election.It is expected to put to rest concerns that Putrajaya was shirking its commitment to Selangor made in the memorandum of understanding signed by the two on February 26.Under the MoU, Putrajaya was supposed to "facilitate" the restructuring of the Selangor water industry.In return, Selangor would grant approvals for the construction of the mega-billion ringgit Langat 2 water treatment plant.Critics of the MoU had claimed the agreement did not extract a strong enough commitment from Putrajaya to use its powers to help Selangor.In contrast, they said, Selangor had to approve the Langat 2 project within 30 days of signing the MoU.In the past, Selangor's plan to take over the four concessionaires reached a stalemate as the firms did not accept the RM9.65 billion offered by the state to acquire them.Before the 13th general election, it had continually pressured the Barisan Nasional government to use its powers under WSIA to take over the four companies, which are Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor (Syabas), Puncak Niaga Sdn Bhd (PNSB), Konsortium Abbas Sdn Bhd (Abbas) and Splash.The firms run 34 water treatment plants in Selangor, except Syabas which is in charge of maintaining the distribution pipes.It was only in September last year that Putrajaya agreed to help the state with the water restructuring exercise, the February 26 deal being the outcome.Under the deal, the four had until March 11 to respond to the RM9.65 billion offer.As of 5pm yesterday, only Abass accepted the offer, while Syabas, PNSB and Splash declined.The statement said the decision to take over the four was jointly made at a meeting between Energy, Green Technology and Water Minister, Datuk Seri Dr Maximus Johnity Ongkili, and Selangor Menteri Besar, Tan Sri Abdul Khalid Ibrahim, this afternoon."At the meeting, Ongkili reaffirmed his commitment to facilitate the state government in taking over the Selangor water industry from the four concessionaires as agreed in the MOU," the statement said. – March 11, 2014.
